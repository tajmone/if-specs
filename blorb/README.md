# About Blorb

In the [Blorb Specification], Blorb is described as:

> [...] a formal specification for a common format for storing resources associated with an interactive fiction game file.
> Resources are data which the game can invoke, such as sounds and pictures.
> In addition, the executable game file may itself be a resource in a resource file.
> This is a convenient way to package a game and all its resources together in one file.
