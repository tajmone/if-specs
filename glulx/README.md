# About Glulx

From the [Glulx homepage]:

> Glulx is a portable VM, like the Z-machine.
> Unlike the Z-machine, it uses 32-bit data and addresses, so it can handle game files up to four gigabytes long.
> Also unlike the Z-machine, it has native support for Glk I/O, so game files can use any capability Glk provides.
> However, like the Z-machine — again — you can write games in the Inform language and compile them to Glulx game files.
