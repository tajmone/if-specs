<h2 id="preamble">1. Preamble</h2>
<h3 id="background">1.1. Background</h3>
<p>Since the 1980s, writers of interactive fiction ("IF") have used a
variety of programs ("design systems") to create new works. Some were
in-house tools used by commercial IF production houses, but from around
1990 IF has been written by a diverse Internet community, using tools
written, tested and evolved within the community. The playable works of
IF produced by design systems ("story files") have in almost all cases
been programs for virtual machines, requiring the use of an emulator
in order to play them (an "interpreter"). With few exceptions, the
virtual machines used by different design systems have been mutually
incompatible. Although a number of multi-format interpreters have been
written, and the IF community prefers a format-independent approach to
reviewing and discussing works of IF, few tools exist (as of the start
of 2006) which treat all formats equally.</p>
<p>One obstacle to the creation of software for playing and archiving IF
in a format-independent way is that few design systems, up to 2006,
have compiled even basic bibliographic data into their story files -
the author and title, for instance. Only one major design system has
approached this problem systematically (TADS 3), though others have
implemented partial solutions, or incorporate data into story files
which - though not intended to be read externally - can allow the
title or author's name to be found.</p>
<p>Most serious works of IF written since 1990 have been placed at the
IF-archive, a community project which - subject to copyright issues -
aims to preserve the whole corpus of IF, making it available to
players of the present and future. Other web-based databases of IF
exist, such as "Baf's Guide", which catalogue reviews and bibliographic
data about works of IF but do not actually archive the story files:
here copyright is not an issue. As a result, the IF-archive is the
most complete collection of actual IF known to exist, but omits some
of the most important early story files (notably Infocom's) for
copyright reasons, and is not currently a useful source of
bibliographic data. This is to be regretted, since such data should
also be preserved. Furthermore, the IF-archive must accept story files
in all formats and generate its own catalogues: the lack of any
systematic way to do this imposes considerable work on the librarians.</p>
<p>We might say that bibliographic data for IF can be provided at three
levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>"internally", that is, it can be printed out by the work of IF - for
instance in the game banner, or in response to a typed VERSION command;</li>
<li>"locally", that is, it can be read and used by the run-time software
playing the story file (the "interpreter"), or by other programs which
have direct access to the file;</li>
<li>"externally", that is, it can exist entirely independently of the
story file, for instance in a bibliographic database like the one kept
by CDDB for published CDs.</li>
</ul>
<p>All IF design systems provide internal metadata, though sometimes
in a not very systematic way. TADS has provided local metadata since
2001 by means of its "Game Information" file format: a TADS story
file can contain what amounts to an embedded text file listing
key/value pairs. As of 2006, Inform 7 makes similar arrangements.
Inform 6 is typical of other 1990s design systems in that it
provides at best patchy local metadata: the Z-machine story files it
compiles expose release numbers and compilation dates at certain
well-defined byte offsets in the file - but not the author's name,
or the title. Prior to this treaty, no design system generated
metadata intended for external use.</p>
<h3 id="aims">1.2. Aims</h3>
<p>The present treaty is an agreement between active design systems, the
IF-archive and other interested parties. It provides for:</p>
<ul>
<li>ISBN-like unique ID numbers for story files, old and new,
    produced by commercial or non-commercial compilers living
    and dead;</li>
<li>a standard format for cover art and bibliographic data;</li>
<li>a web server able to provide these for a given ID number;</li>
<li>a command-line tool able to identify and extract data from
    story files in any format;</li>
<li>reference software providing a format-neutral API for reading
    story files, and removing "wrappers".</li>
</ul>
<p>The aim of the treaty, and of the Babel software, is to make it much
easier to write new tools for players in which the distinction of
which design system created which story file is much less visible.</p>
<h3 id="signatories">1.3. Signatories</h3>
<p>The following parties are the initial signatories:</p>
<ul>
<li>the IF-archive;</li>
<li>the design system ADRIFT;</li>
<li>the design system Hugo;</li>
<li>the design system Inform;</li>
<li>the design system TADS;</li>
<li>the Blorb wrapper format (a packaging system for story files);</li>
<li>the Zoom interpreter for OS X and Unix;</li>
<li>the Windows Frotz interpreter for Windows;</li>
<li>the Babel software.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other design systems and tools are welcome to join. It is important to
note that the treaty also provides for support of works of IF produced
by design systems now obsolete or fallen into disuse.</p>

<h2 id="requirements-on-design-systems">2. Requirements on design systems</h2>
<h3 id="provision-of-metadata-and-cover-art">2.1. Provision of metadata and cover art</h3>
<h4 id="requirements-and-guidelines-for-metadata">2.1.1. Requirements and guidelines for metadata</h4>
<p>A design system is required to provide each newly published work
with basic bibliographic information (or "metadata"). At minimum,
this will be the name of the author and the title of the work,
but a variety of other annotations are also possible. The treaty
provides for a common core of data which can be used and shared
between all tools - for instance, the author, or the date of first
publication - but it does not limit the design system's ability to
provide more, or to provide annotations of its own which are
entirely specific to that system. In addition, the treaty makes
no requirement on the design system to store the information in any
particular format.</p>
<p>While each new work is required to have an author and a title, it
is legal for the design system to set these to "Anonymous" and/or
"An Interactive Fiction" if the author chose not to specify:
provided that the author has been given the opportunity to choose
them, and encouraged to do so by the design system's documentation.</p>
<p>Requirements and guidelines for the common core of metadata are
given in <a href="#the-ifiction-format">&#167;5, "The iFiction format"</a> below.
To clarify the difference: requirements are such
that a file of metadata (an "iFiction record") is illegal if
requirements are broken, and a tool can refuse to deal with it;
whereas tools must expect to have to deal with metadata which
breaks the guidelines. A design system is required to pass on these
guidelines to authors (rephrasing as it sees fit), and may at its
own discretion enforce some of them, but it is not required to
ensure that the guidelines are always kept.</p>
<h4 id="requirements-and-guidelines-for-cover-art">2.1.2. Requirements and guidelines for cover art</h4>
<p>A design system is not required to provide cover art for newly
published works. However, if it does choose to do so, then that
art must conform to the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cover art must be a single square or rectangular JPEG or PNG
image to be used as visual identification of the work, like a CD
sleeve or a book jacket image. A PNG should not contain transparent
pixels.</li>
<li>Each side of the image is required to have a minimum length of
120 pixels. The aspect ratio of the image is required to be between
1:2 and 2:1 inclusive (i.e., it can be twice as tall as it is wide,
or vice versa, but not more than that).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, IF authors should be asked (in the documentation for the
design system) to follow the following guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cover art for new works of IF should be square. (While non-square cover
art is legal, this is provided mainly to enable scanned box covers to
serve as cover art for 1980s commercial IF story files.)</li>
<li>The ideal dimensions for new cover art are 960 by 960.</li>
<li>Neither height nor width should exceed 1200 pixels.</li>
<li>Cover art should be designed in the expectation that it will often
be seen in a thumbnail form where the longer of the two sides is
reduced to 120 pixels. (Thus a square image will be 120 by 120, which
is about 3cm square on most screens.)</li>
<li>Cover art should not actually invite prosecution for obscenity.
Those writing erotica should provide reasonably coy covers, as might
be acceptable to ordinary bookshops. The IF-Archive and other sites
are entitled to refuse to archive any items which do not follow this
guideline.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Present builds of Inform 7 enforce the maximum-of-1200-pixels
guideline as an absolute rule, but that is Inform's choice, and not
a requirement of the treaty.)</p>
<h3 id="the-ifid-unique-identifier">2.2. The IFID unique identifier</h3>
<p>Under the present agreement, each different published work of IF, of
whatever design system (if any), shall have its own unique ID code
(henceforth a "IFID"). This will be analogous to the ISBN code assigned
to each different published book, except that there will be no central
authority handing out numbers: instead, a design system will be allowed
to generate its own IFIDs, using one of the standard unique-ID-number
algorithms. It is an absolute requirement that the new ID is to be
generated in such a way as to be universally unique, not just unique
among projects created by this user or this design system.</p>
<p>The IFID shall be a sequence of between 8 and 63 characters, each of
which shall be a digit, a capital letter or a hyphen.</p>
<p>For example, here is an Inform 7-generated IFID:</p>
<pre><code>1974A053-7DB0-4103-93A1-767C1382C0B7
</code></pre>
<p>As with published books, where an ISBN remains the same even if the
book is reprinted with corrections, the IFID should be associated with
a project, <em>not</em> a specific story file compiled from it. A re-release
with bug fixes should have the same IFID.</p>
<p>If a game is ported from one system to another (other than simply
being moved from one version of a system to the next, e.g., by being
moved from TADS 2 to TADS 3), the port receives a new IFID. Again,
this is analogous to books: a different-format reissue of a book,
such as a paperback of what was previously hardback, gets a new ISBN.</p>
<h4 id="ifids-for-new-projects">2.2.1. IFIDs for new projects</h4>
<p>A design system should assign each different published work a unique
ID code (henceforth a "IFID").</p>
<p>(Inform 7 creates a fresh IFID for a project whenever it opens a project
which does not already have one. The IFID is generated using a UUID
unique ID generating algorithm in the sense of ISO/IEC 11578:1996.
This is transparent to the user, except that a warning has been placed
in the documentation: if a project already having a IFID is duplicated,
and then the two copies are independently developed into quite different
games, then there is a risk of releasing two different works with the
same IFID. The documentation goes on to explain how to duplicate a
project so that this will not occur.)</p>
<h4 id="ifids-for-legacy-projects">2.2.2. IFIDs for legacy projects</h4>
<p>A design system may provide an algorithm to determine a IFID for a
"legacy" story file, i.e., one which pre-dates the present standard.
The method should be reasonably straight-forward and documented
here. Moreover, the design system should then provide an implementation
of this algorithm in portable C: see <a href="#the-babel-tool">&#167;2.3, "The "babel" tool"</a> below.</p>
<p>Legacy story files not covered by such algorithms have IFIDs equal to

<h5 id="the-ifid-for-a-legacy-z-code-story-file">2.2.2.1. The IFID for a legacy Z-code story file</h5>
<p>Inform 7 compiles to Z-code, but by default wraps these Z-code story
files into blorbs. The end user therefore sees the result as a blorb.
However, by means of cutting tools, or by turning off the default
preference, it is possible for the underlying Z-code story file
to get out, and therefore it is possible that interpreters or other
such tools will see "loose" Z-code story files in the wild, even for
I7 projects.</p>
<p>Such story files can be recognised because I7 brands them with the
text such as this:</p>
<pre><code>UUID://1974A053-7DB0-4103-93A1-767C1382C0B7//
</code></pre>
<p>(Recall that I7 uses a UUID-generating algorithm to create IFIDs.)
This text is written in a character array in byte-accessible memory.
Its location cannot be guaranteed, so the whole of byte-accessible
memory must be scanned for the pattern UUID://..//. Note that this
is unnecessary for story files pre-dating 2006.</p>
<p>In the absence of an IFID found branded into the story file itself,
Z-code story files can nevertheless be uniquely identified using numbers
found in their headers (the first 64 bytes of the files). This is
preferable to using MD5 hashes since it results in human-readable
IFIDs, and also because Infocom's original story files sometimes crop
up with spurious tails, e.g. paddings out to what were then disc page
boundaries, usually with zero bytes.</p>
<p>The three identifying elements of the header are:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) The release number, a non-negative integer;</li>
<li>(b) The serial code, almost invariably six digits stored as text;</li>
<li>(c) The checksum, a 16-bit word.</li>
</ul>
<p>Story files can be divided into pre-1990 (Infocom) and post-1990
(Inform). Post-1990 files have regular and reliable data for release
number, serial code and checksum: the combination should safely identify
a file. Pre-1990 files are more variable in how they handle checksums,
in particular, but fortunately there are few of them.</p>
<p>Pre-1990 story files have IFIDs in the following form:</p>
<pre><code>ZCODE-11-860509         Trinity, first release
ZCODE-12-860926         Trinity, second release
</code></pre>
<p>That is, "ZCODE", hyphen, release number, hyphen, serial code. In every
case except three, the serial code will consist of six digits. The
exceptions are:</p>
<pre><code>ZCODE-5-------          Zork I, Z-machine v1 release
ZCODE-15-UG3AU5         Zork I, Z-machine v2 release
ZCODE-7-UG3AU5          Zork II, Z-machine v2 release
</code></pre>
<p>Only one instance is known where the serial code is numerical but does
not consist of the compilation date in YYMMDD format:</p>
<pre><code>ZCODE-67-000000         Sorcerer, beta test version
</code></pre>
<p>Post-1990 story files have IFIDs in the following form:</p>
<pre><code>ZCODE-8-040205-6630     Savoir-Faire, release 8
</code></pre>
<p>Here the format is "ZCODE", hyphen, release number, hyphen, serial code,
hyphen, checksum written as four hexadecimal digits 0...9, A...F.</p>
<p>A sufficient algorithm to determine the IFID is therefore:</p>
<ol>
<li>Look at the start of the serial code. If the serial code
    begins "8" or "9" or "00" to "05", go to step 3.</li>
<li>Scan byte-accessible memory for the pattern of ASCII characters
    UUID://...//, where "..." is a sequence of letters, numbers and
    hyphens. If this is found, that's the IFID. Otherwise continue.</li>
<li>Start with "ZCODE-", the release number, "-".</li>
<li>Copy the six characters of the serial code, converting
    any non-alphanumeric characters (in particular, nulls)
    to hyphens.</li>
<li>If the first character of the serial code is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
    6, 7, or 9, and the serial code is not "000000", add "-" and
    the checksum in hexadecimal.</li>
</ol>
<p>The serial code characters are held in bytes 0x12 to 0x17 of a story
file; the release number is an unsigned integer in bytes 0x02 and 0x03,
the checksum similarly in bytes 0x1C and 0x1D. Thus, for instance, for
Savoir-Faire release 8, the header bytes of the story file include -</p>
<pre><code>0x02    0x00
0x03    0x08
0x12    0x30 = '0'
0x13    0x34 = '4'
0x14    0x30 = '0'
0x15    0x32 = '2'
0x16    0x30 = '0'
0x17    0x35 = '5'
0x1C    0x66
0x1D    0x30
</code></pre>
<p>whence "ZCODE-8-040205-6630".</p>
<h5 id="the-ifid-for-a-legacy-glulx-story-file">2.2.2.2. The IFID for a legacy Glulx story file</h5>
<p>Inform 7-produced Glulx files will be branded with an IFID in the same
manner as Z-code files.</p>
<p>Older Glulx files come in two flavours: those produced by the biplatform
inform compiler, and those produced by other tools.</p>
<p>Inform-produced glulx files provide similar information to Z-code: a
release number, serial number, and checksum, which can be used to
identify them.</p>
<p>Glulx files produced by other tools have only a checksum to identify
them. In this case, the IFID is supplemented by the stated size of
the initial memory map (which is equal to the size of the game file if
it has not been padded).</p>
<p>The size of the initial memory map is stored in a Glulx file as a 4-byte
value beginning at byte address 12.</p>
<p>The checksum is stored in as a 4 byte integer at byte address 32.</p>
<p>An inform-produced Glulx file can be identified by the ASCII sequence
"Info" at byte address 36.</p>
<p>The release number is stored as a 2 byte integer at address 52.</p>
<p>The serial number is 6 ASCII characters beginning at address 54,
traditionally the compilation date.</p>
<p>The algorithm for calculating the IFID of a Glulx file is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Scan byte-accessible memory for the pattern of ASCII characters
   <code>UUID://...//</code>, where "..." is a sequence of letters, numbers and
   hyphens. If this is found, that's the IFID. Otherwise continue.</li>
<li>The IFID begins with "GLULX-".</li>
<li>For inform-generated files, skip to step 5.</li>
<li>For non-inform-generated files, add the size of the initial
   memory map as eight hexadecimal digits and skip to step 7.</li>
<li>Add the release number, in decimal, followed by a hyphen.</li>
<li>Add the serial code, converting any non-alphanumeric characters
   to hyphens.</li>
<li>Add a hyphen, then add the checksum in hexadecimal.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="the-ifid-for-a-legacy-tads2-or-tads3-story-file">2.2.2.3. The IFID for a legacy TADS2 or TADS3 story file</h5>
<p>The IFID for a legacy ".gam" TADS story file is the prefix "TADS2-",

a to f written in upper case, A to F.</p>
<h5 id="the-ifid-for-a-legacy-hugo-story-file">2.2.2.4. The IFID for a legacy Hugo story file</h5>
<p>The IFID for a legacy ".hex" Hugo story file is the prefix "HUGO-"

<h5 id="the-ifid-for-a-legacy-magnetic-scrolls-story-file">2.2.2.5. The IFID for a legacy Magnetic Scrolls story file</h5>
<p>The set of existing Magnetic Scrolls games is small and fixed. As
it is unlikely that any new Magnetic Scrolls story files are liable
to become available in the near future, we have assigned the following
IFIDs for the known Magnetic Scrolls games:</p>
<pre><code>The Pawn                MAGNETIC-1
Guild of Thieves        MAGNETIC-2
Jinxter                 MAGNETIC-3
Corruption              MAGNETIC-4
Fish!                   MAGNETIC-5
Myth                    MAGNETIC-6
Wonderland              MAGNETIC-7
</code></pre>
<p>In several cases, more than one version of a story file is publically
available. In keeping with <a href="#the-ifid-unique-identifier">&#167;2.2, "The IFID unique identifier"</a>,
the story files use the same IFID across all versions.</p>
<p>Each of these can be uniquely identified by the content of bytes 12
through 32 of the story file:</p>
<pre><code>IFID: MAGNETIC-1 00000000D5000000B40000000B00000000000000
IFID: MAGNETIC-2 0001000100000000F10000000E00000000000000

</code></pre>
<p>In the unlikely event that a previously undocumented Magnetic Scrolls
game should come to light, its IFID is "MAGNETIC-" followed by the MD5
hash of the story file.</p>
<h5 id="the-ifid-for-a-legacy-agt-story-file">2.2.2.6. The IFID for a legacy AGT story file</h5>
<p>For historical reasons, AGT files are found in a variety of binary
formats. The most modern of these is the AGX format used by the
AGiliTy interpreter and Magx compiler. As tools to repackage older AGT
binary formats into the AGX format are readily available, for the
purposes of this treaty, we will assume that an "AGT story file"
refers to an AGT program in the AGX format.</p>
<p>An AGT story file can be identified by its AGT version and a 32-bit
game signature.</p>
<p>The AGT version number is stored as a little-endian 16 bit integer at
the beginning of the game header block of of an AGX file.</p>
<p>The AGT version number should be one of the following:</p>
<pre><code>value           AGT version
00000           v1.0
01800           v1.18
01900           v1.19
02000           v1.20           ("Early Classic")
03200           v1.32/COS
03500           v1.35           ("Classic")
05000           v1.5/H
05050           v1.5/F (MDT)
05070           v1.6   (PORK)

15500           ME/1.55
16000           ME/1.6
20000           Magx/0.0
</code></pre>
<p>The last digit may be replaced by '1' to indicate that the game file
is a "large" or "soggy" version.</p>
<p>The game signature is stored as a little-endian 32-bit integer
starting at the third byte in the game header block.</p>
<p>The location of the game header block is stored as a little-endian
32-bit integer stored at position 32 in the AGX file.</p>
<p>The IFID for an AGT game is constructed thus:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with "AGT-"</li>
<li>Add the AGT version as a 5-digit decimal</li>
<li>Add a hyphen, then add the game signature as 8 hexadecimal digits</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="the-ifid-for-a-legacy-level-9-story-file">2.2.2.7. The IFID for a legacy Level 9 story file</h5>
<p>Though level9 files were designed using a platform-independent virtual
machine format, they are generally encountered in a bundle with the
original interpreter in the form of a disk image. In keeping with the
treaty policy on dealing with archive files, the level9 module is not
required to deal with compressed disk images. Users of level9 files
are pointed to Paul David Doherty's l9cut program to extract these
files from their archives.</p>
<p>The following IFIDs have been assigned for Level 9 game files. Level 9
games can be identified by their file size and checksum. For brevity,
the complete table of these is not included here, but can be found in
both the babel source and the source to l9cut.</p>
<pre><code>Adrian Mole I           LEVEL9-001-n (where n is 1-9)
Adrian Mole II          LEVEL9-002-n

</code></pre>
<p>The suffix numbers -n are used to indicate story files which are parts
of a sequence: several Level 9 games were split into independently
playable episodes. "Champion of the Raj" is known to have had French,
English and German versions.</p>
<p>While it is unlikely that any new binaries will come to light, several
historic versions of these games are not currently available for analysis.
In the event that an undocumented Level 9 game should come to light,
its IFID is "LEVEL9-" followed by the MD5 hash of the story file.</p>
<h5 id="the-ifid-for-a-legacy-advsys-story-file">2.2.2.8. The IFID for a legacy AdvSys story file</h5>

<h5 id="the-ifid-for-an-executable-file">2.2.2.9. The IFID for an executable file</h5>
<p>"Executable file" is an inherently vague definition. Any file which
isn't in a known format should be presumptively identified as an
unknown flavour of executable.</p>
<p>For the executable formats listed below, the IFID takes the form:</p>
<p>FORMAT-MD</p>
<p>Where MD is the md5 checksum of the file, and FORMAT is a descriptive
identifier for the particular flavor of executable:</p>
<pre><code>MZ      MS-DOS, Windows or OS/2 Executable
ELF     Linux ELF
JAVA    Java bytecode
AMIGA   AmigaOS executable
SCRIPT  Unix-style shell script
MACHO   MacOS X or GNU/Hurd Mach-O binary
MAC     Pre-MaxOS X Macintosh binary
</code></pre>
<p>For other executable formats, the IFID is the MD5 checksum.</p>
<h4 id="ifids-for-projects-falling-outside-this-agreement">2.2.3. IFIDs for projects falling outside this agreement</h4>
<p>The IFID for a story file, or an executable program, not covered in
the rest of <a href="#the-ifid-unique-identifier">&#167;2.2, "The IFID unique identifier"</a> above or in subsections
below, is by definition its md5 hash code, with hexadecimal characters
a to f written in upper case, A to F.</p>
<h5 id="ifids-for-alan-story-files">2.2.3.1. IFIDs for ALAN story files</h5>
<p>At present the design system ALAN, a living format (i.e., whose
compiler is still in use), is not a signatory to the Treaty: our
attempts to make contact have been unsuccessful. We wish to make it
easy for ALAN to join the Treaty later, if it so chooses.</p>
<p>The IFID for any ALAN story file compiled by a version of ALAN
which does not follow the Treaty is ALAN- followed by the MD5
checksum.</p>
<p>Should ALAN later sign the Treaty, it will likely then begin to
make story files which contain IFIDs allocated by the ALAN compiler.
This clause does not apply to such story files.</p>
<h4 id="the-ifid-for-a-blorbed-story-file">2.2.4. The IFID for a blorbed story file</h4>
<p>Blorb is a wrapper format (see below) which was originally devised
to enable Z-machine games to manage sound and picture resources
better. It was then generalised to handle glulx story files too, and
in March 2006 the specification was opened up to allow its use as
a wrapper for any story file format. It should therefore be assumed
that a blorb might contain almost any kind of story file.</p>
<p>Though blorb can package up other resources too, for our purposes a
blorb archive has three ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>a story file;</li>
<li>a cover image;</li>
<li>a metadata chunk, containing an iFiction record.</li>
</ul>
<p>All three are optional, but a blorb with no story file inside is not
itself a work of IF and so does not have a IFID.</p>
<p>Any blorb generated by Inform 7 is guaranteed to contain a metadata
chunk, but a small number of blorbs created between 2000 and 2005
will not have, and three blorbs in circulation (the preview games
for Inform 7) use a version of iFiction (v0.90) which pre-dates the
standard in this document, and is not entirely compatible with it.
They will be replaced with correct versions, but may still circulate
in their uncorrected form.</p>
<p>The IFID(s) for a blorb should be determined by the following method:</p>
<p>(a) If there is a metadata chunk with an iFiction record (v1.0 or
later), then parse this to find the IFID(s).</p>
<p>(b) Otherwise, the IFID(s) for a blorb is/are the IFID(s) for the
embedded story file, whatever format that has.</p>
<h3 id="the-babel-tool">2.3. The "babel" tool</h3>
<p>The babel utility is intended to be a Swiss army knife for
metadata-related activities. Although the treaty agreement provides for
common behaviours, it is in the babel source code that the treaty's
parties collaborate directly, with functions provided by each system
coming together to make up a single program. The utility is written
in ANSI standard C with a view to portability: it can be compiled
as a command-line tool in its own right, or can be incorporated into
other tools and, in effect, provide them with an API for handling
metadata and cover art independently of story file format.</p>
<p>A central maintainer is responsible for the whole, while each design
system is responsible for its own contribution.</p>
<h4 id="wrappers-and-formats">2.3.1. Wrappers and formats</h4>
<p>Babel's function is to examine a (possibly wrapped) story file and read
its IFID(s), metadata and cover art, and to do so in a way which is
independent of the wrapper and story file formats used. As detailed
below, it provides these services with a common interface regardless
of format: the mechanism to extract the title and author of a TADS
story file, for instance, is the same as that for a zcode story file.</p>
<p>By "wrapper" is meant a format which takes a story file, bundles it
up with associated material, and results in a single object in the
player's computer. To qualify as a wrapper format, a format should -</p>
<ul>
<li>(i) be used natively by one or more interpreters or browsers;</li>
<li>(ii) include a story file in a format which can also exist and
    be played without the surrounding wrapper.</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance, a .zip archive of a game's distribution does not count
as a wrapper in this sense, since it isn't playable without unzipping:
so it breaks (i). And it could not be said that the zcode format was
a wrapper for the actual block of interpreted code in a story file,
because the latter cannot exist separately from the header and its
initial tables, which breaks (ii).</p>
<p>At present the only wrapper in usage is Blorb, a format used to bind
up both zcode and glulx story files with bibliographic data, cover
art, pictures and sounds. But we might imagine other wrappers in
future: for instance, it would be possible to imagine a .rar archive
which was interpreted directly, as in the example of the "comic
book RAR" (.cbr) format used by collectors of digital comics. Babel
is therefore written in such a way that support for other wrappers
can be added as needed.</p>
<p>Babel is further written so that, as far as it is concerned, any
supported wrapper can be used in conjunction with any supported
format. Nobody has ever tried to wrap a TADS story file in a blorb,
but if the blorb standard were revised to allow such a pairing, Babel
would have no difficulty with the combination.</p>
<p>Babel examines an object file in two stages:</p>
<pre><code>Read file   --&gt;   Look at wrapper if any   --&gt;   Look at format
</code></pre>
<p>It may well be that what Babel needs to find - the cover image, for
instance - is provided by the wrapper. If so, it may not get to the
second stage of looking at the format of the story file inside.</p>
<p>Code to handle wrappers is the responsibility of the maintainer of
Babel. Code to handle the story file formats is the responsibility
of the design system producing those formats, as outlined below.</p>
<h4 id="contributing-to-babel">2.3.2. Contributing to "babel"</h4>
<p>Each design system is asked to contribute a file containing a portable,
rights-free C routine to provide babel with support for its run-time
format. It may be assumed that "int32" is a 32-bit or larger signed
integer.</p>
<p>In the case of TADS 3, for instance, the file is "tads3.c": Inform
contributes both "zcode.c" and "glulx.c", since it compiles to two
independent virtual machines.</p>
<p>The specification below describes what this file should contain.
Setting up such a file involves a certain amount of work: the
prototype babel distribution includes a header file,
"treaty_builder.h", which offers C preprocessor macros able to
simplify the process. However, it is not required that these macros
be used: only that the end result of writing is a file satisfying
the following description.</p>
<p>The routine visible to, and used by, babel shall have the form:</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>int32 SYSTEM_treaty(int32 selector,
    void *story_file, int32 story_file_extent,
    void *output, int32 output_extent)
</code></pre>

<p>where the prefix "SYSTEM_" is "tads3_", "zcode_", etc., as appropriate.
(When other design systems are added, these prefixes should coincide
with the <code>&lt;format&gt;</code> value used in iFiction - see <a href="#the-ifiction-format">&#167;5, "The iFiction format"</a>.)
The implementation may create as many other routines, constants, etc.,
as it chooses, provided their names have the same prefix.</p>
<p>The selector may be one of the following constants, in which case
the state of the pointers on entry is as given:</p>
<pre><code>selector                            story_file  output
GET_FORMAT_NAME_SEL                 NULL        not NULL
GET_STORY_FILE_EXTENSION_SEL        NULL        not NULL
GET_HOME_PAGE_SEL                   NULL        not NULL
GET_FILE_EXTENSIONS_SEL             NULL        not NULL
CLAIM_STORY_FILE_SEL                not NULL    NULL
GET_STORY_FILE_METADATA_EXTENT_SEL  not NULL    NULL
GET_STORY_FILE_COVER_EXTENT_SEL     not NULL    NULL
GET_STORY_FILE_COVER_FORMAT_SEL     not NULL    NULL
GET_STORY_FILE_IFID_SEL             not NULL    not NULL
GET_STORY_FILE_METADATA_SEL         not NULL    not NULL
GET_STORY_FILE_COVER_SEL            not NULL    not NULL
</code></pre>
<p>Where one of the pointers is NULL, its given extent will be 0;
where it is not NULL, it must point to byte-accessible memory of
the given extent. "story_file" points to a complete story file,
fully loaded into memory: the routine must not write to this.
This will always be the actual story file: if babel is working on
a blorb which contains a zcode-format story file, say, the pointer
will be to the zcode story file.</p>
<p>"output" points to a buffer to which text or other data can be
written. On entry, the contents of this buffer are undefined.
If text is written to the buffer, it should be null terminated.
Under no circumstances may the buffer be written beyond its
extent; but the extent is guaranteed to be at least 512 bytes.
Text in the buffer must be encoded with UTF-8 Unicode.</p>
<p>The return value of the treaty routine will be one of the following:</p>
<pre><code>NO_REPLY_RV
INVALID_STORY_FILE_RV
UNAVAILABLE_RV
IMPROPER_USAGE_RV
</code></pre>
<p>or else a positive integer value depending on the selector.</p>
<p><code>NO_REPLY_RV</code> is used either if there is no meaningful return value,
or if the requested data cannot be found in the story file, but
there was no indication that the story file was broken or invalid.
(The routine is <em>not</em> required to check the story file for validity:
it is simply asked to report any problem it does hit.)</p>
<p><code>INVALID_STORY_FILE_RV</code> means that something went wrong, and that the
story file looks to be broken or invalid.</p>
<p><code>UNAVAILABLE_RV</code> means that support for this selector is not provided,
and it should be returned if the selector is not recognised (in
case new selectors are added in a later revision of this standard).</p>
<p><code>IMPROPER_USAGE_RV</code> means that the selector believes it has been called
with parameters which are not as they should be, according to the
specification above.</p>
<p>To take the selectors in turn:</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>GET_FORMAT_NAME_SEL
</code></pre>

<p>Copies the design system's format into the output buffer: e.g.,
"tads2". This must be the value as defined in
<a href="#the-ifiction-format">&#167;5, "The iFiction format"</a> below under <code>&lt;format&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Returns <code>NO_REPLY_RV</code>.</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>GET_STORY_FILE_EXTENSION_SEL
</code></pre>

<p>Outputs the single best extension for the given story file.  Thus,
".z5" for version 5 Z-code, ".gam" for TADS 2, etc.  Returns the
length of the output string, or a suitable error value.  This
should return zero only if this particular game file should not
have any extension.</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>GET_HOME_PAGE_SEL
</code></pre>

<p>Copies a URL for the design system's home page into the output
buffer: e.g., "http://www.tads.org/".</p>
<p>Returns <code>NO_REPLY_RV</code>.</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>GET_FILE_EXTENSIONS_SEL
</code></pre>

<p>Copies a comma-separated list of filename extensions typically
associated with the design system, flattened to lower case, into
the output buffer:
e.g., for zcode, ".z3,.z4,.z5,.z6,.z7,.z8"
(note: ".blorb", ".zblorb", etc., are not included: babel handles
blorbs automatically)</p>
<p>Returns <code>NO_REPLY_RV</code>.</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>CLAIM_STORY_FILE_SEL
</code></pre>

<p>Returns <code>NO_REPLY_RV</code> if this appears to be a story file produced
by this design system; or <code>INVALID_STORY_FILE_RV</code> if not.</p>
<p>(Only the most casual, superficial check is needed. For instance,
the first twelve bytes of a blorb always match <code>FORM????IFRS</code> for
some <code>????</code>, and this is unlikely to be true of a randomly found file
which is not a blorb. So checking those twelve bytes is sufficient
to say that the file "appears to be" a blorb.)</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>GET_STORY_FILE_METADATA_EXTENT_SEL
</code></pre>

<p>Returns the extent (in bytes) of the iFiction record for the story
file, plus 1 (to allow for a zero termination byte); or, if there
is no metadata, returns <code>NO_REPLY_RV</code>. This is likely to be called
immediately before <code>GET_STORY_FILE_METADATA_SEL</code>, in order to
establish what size of output buffer is needed to hold the metadata.</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>GET_STORY_FILE_METADATA_SEL
</code></pre>

<p>Copies the metadata for the story file, in "iFiction" format, to
the output buffer, together with a zero termination byte, and
returns the total number of bytes copied (including the zero
termination byte); or, if there is no metadata, returns <code>NO_REPLY_RV</code>.</p>
<p>If the output buffer is too small, returns <code>IMPROPER_USAGE_RV</code>.</p>
<p>Note that it is <em>not</em> required that the story file contain metadata
written in "iFiction" format: only that this selector is able
to translate its metadata into "iFiction" format on request.
Similarly, it is not required that the story file's own metadata be
encoded in UTF-8 Unicode, only that the metadata be written in that
encoding when this selector does its work. It should run quickly in
comparison with file input/output, but does not especially need to
be fast.</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>GET_STORY_FILE_COVER_EXTENT_SEL
</code></pre>

<p>Returns the extent (in bytes) of the cover art image in the story
file, if there is one; or, if not, returns <code>NO_REPLY_RV</code>. This is
likely to be called immediately before <code>GET_STORY_FILE_COVER_SEL</code>,
in order to establish what size of output buffer is needed to
hold the cover art.</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>GET_STORY_FILE_COVER_SEL
</code></pre>

<p>Copies the cover art for the story file into the output buffer,
returning the size in bytes; or, if there is no cover art,
returns <code>NO_REPLY_RV</code>.</p>
<p>If the output buffer is too small, returns <code>IMPROPER_USAGE_RV</code>.</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>GET_STORY_FILE_COVER_FORMAT_SEL
</code></pre>

<p>Returns <code>JPEG_COVER_FORMAT</code> if the cover art is in JPEG (JFIF)
format; <code>PNG_COVER_FORMAT</code> if the cover art is in PNG format;
<code>NO_REPLY_RV</code> if there is no cover art. No other formats of cover
art are legal.</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>GET_STORY_FILE_IFID_SEL
</code></pre>

<p>Finds the IFID(s) and copies them as a comma-separated list into
the output buffer, and then returns the number of IFIDs in the
list; or returns <code>NO_REPLY_RV</code> if no IFID could be determined.</p>
<h4 id="algorithm-for-determining-the-format-of-a-story-file">2.3.3. Algorithm for determining the format of a story file</h4>
<p>(a) If a story file is a blorb, then the blorb executable chunk
records the format of the real story file inside. This should be
checked by seeing if the relevant format's <code>CLAIM_STORY_FILE_SEL</code>
selector is happy: if not, then babel is allowed to declare the
story file invalid. The blorb is similarly deemed invalid if this
format disagrees with the format claimed in its metadata chunk
(if there is one).</p>
<p>(b) If not, then we have a story file which might be one of many
formats, or might even be (say) an MS-DOS executable. The filename
extension is considered as providing a clue, so:</p>
<ul>
<li>(i) Babel runs through the formats, polling each with
    <code>GET_FILE_EXTENSIONS_SEL</code> to see if the file extension is one
    that any of them know. This makes a list of "likely" formats
    (extension matching) and a list of the remaining "unlikely"
    ones.</li>
<li>(ii) Babel offers the story file to each likely format in turn
    with <code>CLAIM_STORY_FILE_SEL</code>; then to each unlikely format in turn.
    The first to claim the story file is the winner. If no format
    claims it, then the format is "unknown".</li>
<li>(iii) Within each list - the likely and unlikely lists, that is -
    the formats are checked in popularity order, i.e., in order of
    the size of the published corpus for the formats: so probably
    zcode, then tads2, then any others which may provide treaty
    routines.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="guidelines-for-interpreters-and-browsers">3. Guidelines for interpreters and browsers</h2>
<p>An "interpreter" is a program which plays the story file: for some
design systems a single "run-time" program is provided; for others
a variety of rival interpreters exist. A "browser" is a program which
manages and offers a choice of story files. One may imagine an
interpreter which is not a browser - it would only play a single
story file; and one may imagine a browser which is not an
interpreter - it would play story files by calling an external
application (i.e., an interpreter for the given format). But it is
also possible to write tools which are both browsers and interpreters.</p>
<p>There are no formal requirements on these tools, but the spirit of
this standard is that the following will be considered good practice.
Some of these guidelines are applicable to interpreters, some to
browsers, and some to both.</p>
<p>(a) To use basic bibliographic data if it is available, even if
only to give windows and/or saved games sensible titles, or to
provide an "About this Game" menu option;</p>
<p>(b) If possible, to be able to show a preview of a game based on its
cover art and bibliographic data, before play begins;</p>
<p>(c) If possible, to be able to browse through a selection of games,
tabulated using their bibliographic data;</p>
<p>(d) If possible, to be able to show previews and to browse story
files compiled by any design system signing up to the standard,
though probably "playing" them by launching an external application -
the run-time for the design system in question; failing that, to
display a message such as "Lady Eustace's Diamonds appears to be
a work of interactive fiction in XYZ format. You will need to
obtain special XYZ software in order to play it." and a link to
the XYZ home page.</p>
<p>(e) If possible, to allow the user to edit the metadata of games
in his collection (in a way which does <em>not</em> involve alteration to
the story file, but simply editing of the interpreter's own copy
of the metadata for its archive of games - see below);</p>
<p>(f) If possible, given an object with no metadata, or no obvious
file type, to attempt to fetch metadata and/or cover art for it
from the IF-Archive (see below), and then employ this in the
ways suggested above.</p>
<p>Interpreters or browsers fetching cover art from the IF-Archive
are <em>required</em> to cache the images they fetch, in order to minimise
bandwidth usage. They should be written on the assumption that a
fetch may take several seconds.</p>
<h2 id="requirements-on-the-if-archive">4. Requirements on the IF-archive</h2>
<p>When authors complete and wish to publish a new work, they
"upload" it to the IF-archive's incoming folder. There it remains
until one of the librarians works through the new uploads and files
them appropriately: we shall call this "accessioning". Users of the
IF-archive can browse the directories freely, and download as they
like.</p>
<p>As part of this new standard, however, the IF-archive will offer
further services: it will provide metadata on request ("serving")
to any interpreters or other tools which ask for it, and it will
accept metadata on existing works (whether or not archived) as they
are provided by volunteers ("contributing").</p>
<p>Note that other archives could provide similar facilities: it would be
natural to be able to access Baf's Guide via the IFID, and this would
make a neat way for interpreters to point to reviews, etc., on a game.</p>
<h3 id="uploading">4.1. Uploading</h3>
<p>A story file may be uploaded as a single object, such as
"Henrietta.zblorb" or "DDD.gam", or as a zipped archive such as
"Bronze.zip", which contains both the story file and its associated
external resources - manuals, maps, etc., typically in plain text
or PDF format, and might expand to a short set of files as follows:</p>
<pre><code>Bronze.zblorb
Bronze Manual.pdf
Map.pdf
solution.txt
</code></pre>
<h3 id="accessioning">4.2. Accessioning</h3>
<p>(a) When a newly uploaded work is accessioned, the librarian should
run the "babel" command-line tool to examine the story file. This
will produce the IFID (always), file(s) containing the iFiction record
(if any) and the cover image (if any).</p>
<p>If the iFiction record contains several IFIDs, as for instance to
list multiple releases of an Infocom game under a common IFID (see
<a href="#identification">&#167;5.5, "Identification"</a> below), "babel" will create one copy of both the
record and the image, filenamed with each IFID.</p>
<p>(b) If any IFID duplicates one already held by the IF-archive, the
librarian will investigate to see if they are essentially different
works:</p>
<ul>
<li>(i) If so, the new upload will be rejected, and the author will
    have to resubmit. Such accidents are likely to be rare.</li>
<li>(ii) If not, the upload will be allowed, and will become the
    "main" version held by the IF-archive under that IFID: the new
    upload's cover art and iFiction will replace the old. The
    librarian may, at his discretion, delete the old story file, so
    that only the new version remains. Such replacements with
    revised versions are likely to be fairly common.</li>
</ul>
<p>(c) If there is an iFiction file, it will be filed in some appropriate
directory as</p>
<pre><code>XXXXX.iFiction
</code></pre>
<p>where XXXXX is the IFID.</p>
<p>(d) If there is a cover image, it will be reduced in size to the
standard thumbnail dimensions: that is, such that its longer side is
120 pixels. (This will usually mean it is 120 by 120.) A standard
Unix tool such as "sips" should be able to do this easily enough.
The result will be filed in some appropriate directory as</p>
<pre><code>XXXXX.png  or  XXXXX.jpg
</code></pre>
<p>where XXXXX is the IFID.</p>
<h3 id="serving">4.3. Serving</h3>
<p>The IF-archive will arrange that page hits are URLs in the following
IFID-based form result in predictable data served back:</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>http://babel.ifarchive.org/metadata/IFID
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>fetches the iFiction record for this IFID, giving it the mime
type of a UTF-8 Unicode text file, as indeed it is; or fetches
a 404 error page if no metadata exists for this IFID</li>
</ul>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>http://babel.ifarchive.org/cover/IFID
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>fetches the cover art, as a JPEG or PNG, or a 404 error page</li>
</ul>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>http://babel.ifarchive.org/download/IFID
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>fetches the story file, or a 404 error page</li>
</ul>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>http://babel.ifarchive.org/holdings/IFID/*
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>fetches the file * associated with this IFID. Here, "*" would be
the leafname: "Bronze Manual.pdf", for instance</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="contributing">4.4. Contributing</h3>
<p>(a) The IF-archive will provide mechanisms for volunteers to upload
records on games which are not themselves being uploaded, via a
web page form and/or an ftp folder for uploads.</p>
<p>Volunteers will be asked to upload one record for each game, in
the form of a folder (or zip archive) which contains the following:</p>
<pre><code>metadata.iFiction
cover.jpg   or   cover.png (optional)
url.txt (optional)
</code></pre>
<p>The archive is free to reject uploads not following this rule.</p>
<p>The "url.txt" file contains the location in the Archive, if data is
being provided on a story file which is already there. Volunteers will
be instructed to supply a complete URL.</p>
<p>(b) Such uploads will also be periodically accessioned by a
librarian. Each .iFiction file will be run through "babel", which will
reject it if it does not properly conform to the iFiction format,
but will otherwise print out the IFID(s) and make canonically-named
copies, one for each IFID. The image will also be canonically
named, reduced if necessary as in 4.2 above, and duplicated if
necessary.</p>
<ul>
<li>(i) If, in the librarian's opinion, a better record already exists
    for that IFID, the new one will be rejected.    </li>
<li>(ii) If a "url.txt" file is provided, the librarian will check
    the IFID of the story file at that location using "babel": if it
    differs from the one claimed, the IFID produced by "babel" is
    deemed to be the correct one.</li>
</ul>
<p>(c) Image and .iFiction file(s) will then be stored, ready to be served
as in 4.3 above.</p>
<h2 id="the-ifiction-format">5. The iFiction format</h2>
<h3 id="purpose-and-scope">5.1. Purpose and scope</h3>
<p>This format was created for Andrew Hunter's Z-machine interpreter
"Zoom", which collects and organises interactive fiction story files in
the same way that Apple's "iTunes" collects and organises music files.
"iFiction" was the format of Zoom's database of metadata tags for its
story files: compare, for instance, the XML file output by the "Export
Library" menu option in iTunes. The format was used experimentally by
Zoom, then amended and introduced as a new segment into the Inform
wrapper format Blorb: the first published story files to contain
embedded iFiction records appeared in February 2006, though this
treaty revises the format substantially from that original state.</p>
<p>The metadata associated with a story file will be called its "iFiction
record". If we compare the story file to the pages of a book written
by the author, then the iFiction record is the text printed on the
cover, title and imprint pages - the part of a book normally put
together by the publisher. The content is comparable with the release
information handed out to distributors by record companies, or the
Neilson book database which feeds Amazon and similar sites.</p>
<p>The iFiction record is primarily intended for bibliographic purposes:
that is, purposes such as identification, classification, automated
downloading, librarianship. It is not suitable for indexing the textual
content of a work of IF, nor for expressing machine-followable
cross-references between works of IF, or between IF story files and
otherwise unrelated cultural artefacts (such as printed books). While
the description of work A could certainly say that is a translation
into French of work B, for instance, or an adaptation of Dickens's
"A Tale of Two Cities", iFiction does not provide machine-followable
links. (Equipped with Google, any reader of iFiction data would have
no trouble in finding such remote resources manually.) iFiction
records are written in XML rather than any more sophisticated data
representation language so that only very light tools are needed to
handle it: iFiction text is easy to read, write and transmit via
email or the Web.</p>
<p>The iFiction record is also not intended to specify a license for the
story file, though design systems are entitled to record this in their
own segments of the iFiction format if they wish to do so. Nothing
should be inferred from the absence of such license information in
the iFiction record. Similarly, the copyright record for a story file
is recorded in the file itself, and not in the iFiction record.</p>
<h3 id="encoding">5.2. Encoding</h3>
<p>An iFiction record is encoded in UTF-8 Unicode.</p>
<p>Where iFiction data is stored in a file, this file should have the
file extension ".iFiction". It is permitted to begin with the UTF-8
encoding of the Unicode BOM sequence, 0xEF 0xBB 0xBF, which serves as
an optional marker of the encoding type; but it is not required to
do so.</p>
<h3 id="storage-in-files">5.3. Storage in files</h3>
<p>An iFiction file should take the form:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;ifindex version="1.0" xmlns="http://babel.ifarchive.org/protocol/iFiction/"&gt;
    &lt;!-- Bibliographic data recorded by Inform 7 build 3F47 --&gt;
    ...
&lt;/ifindex&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>where "..." is a sequence of one or more story file records. The
comment is optional and should not be parsed by tools looking at the
record; Inform writes in such a comment merely for the sake of helping
to debug if problems are found in the records it writes.</p>
<p>(The ability to hold more than one story file record is provided so
that an interpreter, or similar tool, can use the same schema for a
database of all the metadata known to it.)</p>
<p>The name-space is defined in the root element <code>&lt;ifindex&gt;</code> to facilitate
future developments, and to make it easier for XML tools to merge
data from iFiction files.</p>
<h3 id="story-file-records">5.4. Story file records</h3>
<p>Data on an individual story file is given within <code>&lt;story&gt;</code> ... <code>&lt;/story&gt;</code>
tags. This is in turn subdivided:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;story&gt;
    &lt;identification&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/identification&gt;
    &lt;bibliographic&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/bibliographic&gt;
    ...
&lt;/story&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>We shall call these subdivisions "sections". The sections are:</p>
<pre><code>tag                                 who originates the data
&lt;identification&gt;    mandatory       design system
&lt;bibliographic&gt;     mandatory       author
&lt;resources&gt;         optional        author
&lt;contacts&gt;          optional        author
&lt;cover&gt;             optional        design system
&lt;releases&gt;          optional        design system
&lt;colophon&gt;          optional        design system, or browser tool, etc.
&lt;annotation&gt;        optional        third parties, player's tools, etc.
&lt;zcode&gt;             optional*       design system
&lt;tads2&gt;             optional*       design system
&lt;tads3&gt;             optional*       design system
&lt;glulx&gt;             optional*       design system
&lt;hugo&gt;              optional*       design system
&lt;adrift&gt;            optional*       design system
</code></pre>
<p>* Permitted only if the project belongs to this format, so that at most
one of these can be given: but it is legal not to give it at all.</p>
<p><code>&lt;annotation&gt;</code> is a special case. A design system is forbidden to produce
an <code>&lt;annotation&gt;</code> section in the iFiction records it produces. The
section is expressly intended for third parties: for players, annotating
their own collections using iTunes-like browsers; for review sites such
as Baf's Guide, recording reviews, ratings and other user experiences;
and so on. Whether the IF-archive will serve records containing
<code>&lt;annotation&gt;</code> is a matter of policy for the archive, and not governed
here.</p>
<p>All other sections can be produced by a design system, but those marked
above as originating with the author will stem fairly directly from
the author's explicit instructions, whereas the others are likely to be
generated automatically on his behalf. (For instance, the author will at
some stage actually type the title, but the design system would likely
calculate the pixel dimensions of the cover art, the serial number of
the compiled story file, etc., automatically on each compilation.)</p>
<h3 id="identification">5.5. Identification</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;identification&gt;</code> section is mandatory. The content here identifies
to which story file the metadata belongs. (This is necessary because
the metadata may be held on some remote server, quite separate from
the story file.)</p>
<p>This section contains two mandatory tags and one optional one, as
in the following example:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;identification&gt;
    &lt;ifid&gt;1974A053-7DB0-4103-93A1-767C1382C0B7&lt;/ifid&gt;
    &lt;format&gt;zcode&lt;/format&gt;
    &lt;bafn&gt;55&lt;/bafn&gt;
&lt;/identification&gt;
</code></pre>
<h4 id="ifid">5.5.1. <code>&lt;ifid&gt;</code></h4>
<p>Note that there <em>must</em> be at least one IFID: this may, of course, be
an MD5 checksum. With all new IF projects, a design system should
supply one and only one IFID. Subsequent releases with bugs fixed,
etc., will have the same IFID as the first-published story file.</p>
<p>But in an iFiction record for an old commercial work of IF existing
in multiple releases, it is legal to quote more than one IFID. For
instance, here is the <code>&lt;identification&gt;</code> section of a record which
the IF-archive could usefully hold on Infocom's "Sorcerer" (1984):</p>
<pre><code>&lt;identification&gt;
    &lt;ifid&gt;ZCODE-18-860904&lt;/ifid&gt;
    &lt;ifid&gt;ZCODE-15-851108&lt;/ifid&gt;
    &lt;ifid&gt;ZCODE-13-851021&lt;/ifid&gt;
    &lt;ifid&gt;ZCODE-6-840508&lt;/ifid&gt;
    &lt;ifid&gt;ZCODE-4-840131&lt;/ifid&gt;
    &lt;ifid&gt;ZCODE-67-000000&lt;/ifid&gt;
    &lt;format&gt;zcode&lt;/format&gt;
&lt;/identification&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>When an iFiction record relates to a second or subsequent edition of
a work which previously had a different IFID, it is similarly legal
to give the IFIDs of earlier versions. For example, for Emily Short's
"Savoir-Faire" (2004),</p>
<pre><code>&lt;identification&gt;
    &lt;ifid&gt;731F0480-5CB5-4340-B65B-384FC6B1F5B4&lt;/ifid&gt;
    &lt;ifid&gt;ZCODE-8-040205-6630&lt;/ifid&gt;
    &lt;format&gt;zcode&lt;/format&gt;
&lt;/identification&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This is generated by Inform 7 when it makes a new blorbed edition out
of an old Inform 6-compiled story file: the I7 IFID comes first.</p>
<p>In all cases of doubt, if a single IFID must be extracted, the first
one occurring in the story file should be used. Note that the first
IFID in the example for "Sorcerer", above, is the final release -
the best one to have.</p>
<h4 id="format">5.5.2. <code>&lt;format&gt;</code></h4>
<p>The <code>&lt;format&gt;</code> is also mandatory, and here there can be only one value
supplied. It is the format of the story file to be executed, not the
name of the design system which compiled it; and in the case of a
wrapper format such as Blorb, it is the format of the story file
inside, so that "<code>&lt;format&gt;blorb&lt;/format&gt;</code>" is incorrect. The value of
<code>&lt;format&gt;</code> may therefore be one of the following:</p>
<pre><code>zcode, glulx, tads2, tads3, hugo, alan, adrift, level9, agt,
magscrolls, advsys, html, executable
</code></pre>
<p>No distinction is made here between sub-versions (e.g. v4 of the
Z-machine vs. v8 of the Z-machine): the distinction between TADS 2
and TADS 3 is made because their virtual machines are so completely
different that there is no joint interpreter. (It is thought that
no TADS 1 files exist in the wild: if any are found, they have
format "tads2" for purposes of this Treaty.) The idea is that the
main interpreters for any given format are always likely to be able
to handle all the likely sub-versions of that format which they
encounter. A design system wanting to record more detail on the
format is free to do so within its own part of the iFiction record.</p>
<p>The format "html" means that this is an HTML file, perhaps collected
with associated files such as CSS and Javascript. The intended
interpreter is a standard web browser.</p>
<p>The format "executable" means that this is not a virtual-machine-based
story file but a program for a physical machine: say, an old MS-DOS
executable. There is therefore no applicable interpreter. This
format is only likely to be seen in external metadata, at sites such
as the IF-archive.</p>
<p>Other format values may be added in future revisions. A value not
listed above may be assumed to be in informal use by the users of an
IF system not yet part of the Treaty. We expect that such systems
will be added to this document in due course.</p>
<p>(New format values must not collide with tag names already defined by
this document. This ensures that format-specific tags can be used
without confusion.)</p>
<h4 id="bafn">5.5.3. <code>&lt;bafn&gt;</code></h4>
<p>This is an optional tag, whose value is a non-negative integer. If
supplied, it should be the "Baf's Guide to the IF Archive" identifying
number for the work: for instance, "Curses" is 55; "The PK Girl" is
1897.</p>
<p>This tag is provided solely for the convenience of people who wish
to translate existing metadata at Baf's Guide to new iFiction records,
particularly for items in obscure or long-dead formats. Its use is
not required.</p>
<p>It is not expected that iFiction records generated for new games
by design systems will contain this tag.</p>
<h3 id="bibliographic">5.6. Bibliographic</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;bibliographic&gt;</code> section is mandatory.</p>
<p>This section contains bibliographic data. The tags inside can occur in
any order and all are optional except <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;author&gt;</code>, which are
mandatory. Example:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;bibliographic&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Lakeside Living&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;author&gt;Emily Short&lt;/author&gt;
    &lt;language&gt;en-US&lt;/language&gt;
    &lt;headline&gt;An Interactive Example&lt;/headline&gt;
    &lt;firstpublished&gt;2006&lt;/firstpublished&gt;
    &lt;genre&gt;Fiction&lt;/genre&gt;
    &lt;group&gt;Inform&lt;/group&gt;
    &lt;forgiveness&gt;Merciful&lt;/forgiveness&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;This is example 194, for what it's worth.&lt;/description&gt;
&lt;/bibliographic&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The rules below are once again divided into requirements (no system
generating iFiction records is permitted to violate these) and
guidelines (which authors should be encouraged to follow, and design
systems are at liberty to force them to follow, but which other tools
should not assume have always been followed).</p>
<p>General requirements for the <code>&lt;bibliographic&gt;</code> section:</p>
<ul>
<li>These values are all textual except <code>&lt;seriesnumber&gt;</code>, which is a
non-negative integer.</li>
<li>A textual value is a sequence of one or more Unicode characters in
which the following string escapes, and no others, must be used:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="Plain"><code>&amp;       &amp;amp;
&lt;       &amp;lt;
&gt;       &amp;gt;
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>A textual tag value other than <code>&lt;description&gt;</code> must not contain any
white space except for single spaces, which must not occur at the start
or end of the string. (Thus tab characters, non-breaking and thin spaces,
etc., are prohibited, as is leading or trailing space, and doubled
spacing such as "... here.  Between sentences...".)</li>
<li>A textual tag value is not permitted to be the empty string.</li>
<li>Uniquely, the <code>&lt;description&gt;</code> value is permitted to contain paragraph
breaks, which must be encoded as "<code>&lt;br/&gt;</code>". The description is nevertheless
written in plain text, not HTML, and can contain no other tags. The other
textual values must not contain any tags in angle-brackets.</li>
<li>The <code>&lt;description&gt;</code> is permitted to contain white space in the form
of newlines and tab characters, and to contain multiple white space
characters in succession: these are always treated as single spaces.
However, the <code>&lt;description&gt;</code> must not begin or end with white space, and
must not be empty.</li>
</ul>
<p>General guidelines for the <code>&lt;bibliographic&gt;</code> section:</p>
<ul>
<li>While there is in principle no upper limit on the length of the
textual values, writers of interpreters and browsers will wish to
truncate any over-long values in their own displays: it is recommended
that such truncation occur at 240 characters for each tag except
<code>&lt;description&gt;</code>, where up to 2400 characters should be permitted.
Authors should be made aware of this likely truncation.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="title">5.6.1. <code>&lt;title&gt;</code></h4>
<p>The <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag is mandatory. If no title is known, the correct
form is</p>
<pre><code>&lt;title&gt;An Interactive Fiction&lt;/title&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>A design system should make determined efforts to get the author to
provide a title.</li>
<li><code>&lt;title&gt;</code> text should be given in normal title capitalisation for the
work's language: for English, that would mean caps on the first word,
and on each subsequent word other than prepositions ("at", "between",
etc.), articles ("the", "a", "an") and connectives ("and", "of", etc.).</li>
<li>If there is a subtitle, best form is to use a colon in between title
and subtitle:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="Plain"><code>&lt;title&gt;Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz&lt;/title&gt;
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Interpreters and other tools which search or sort on this field
should do so case-insensitively, and following normal natural language
conventions for the language in question (which may be assumed to be
English if there is no other indication). For English, that would mean
disregarding any of the initial articles "The", "A", "An". Thus in an
alphabetical listing by title, "A Change in the Weather" should appear
under C.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="author">5.6.2. <code>&lt;author&gt;</code></h4>
<p>The <code>&lt;author&gt;</code> tag is mandatory. If no author is known, the correct
form is</p>
<pre><code>&lt;author&gt;Anonymous&lt;/author&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>A design system should make determined efforts to get the author to
give his or her name, or else take some active step to declare him or
herself anonymous.</li>
<li>The <code>&lt;author&gt;</code> must be a name or names, and must not be a sentence or
partial sentence describing the authorship (e.g. "by James Madison",
"written by Geoffrey Chaucer", "a novelty by Jack Djill").</li>
<li>The <code>&lt;author&gt;</code> tag can certainly contain pseudonyms, but should not be
used for e.g. email addresses or IRC handles.</li>
<li>Names should be capitalised as the author wishes, except that they
should not be given entirely in upper case: for instance "Humphrey Sponge",
"Donna de Vries", "Marmaduke X. ffrench". Initials should be followed
by full stops, as shown. If there are multiple initials, these should
be spaced: "T. F. Shuttlecock", not "T.F. Shuttlecock".</li>
<li>The author of a commercially published work should be its actual
author, not the name of the company. Thus the <code>&lt;author&gt;</code> of "Spellbreaker"
is "P. David Lebling", not "Infocom".</li>
<li>Where there are co-authors, a list can be given. Use "and", not an
ampersand. Thus: "Emily Short and Andrew Plotkin". If there are three
or more authors, the serial comma may be used or not, as the authors
prefer; and their names can occur in whatever order they prefer.</li>
<li>Interpreters and other tools which search or sort on this field
should, again, do so case-insensitively.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="language">5.6.3. <code>&lt;language&gt;</code></h4>
<p>The <code>&lt;language&gt;</code> tag is optional, and records the language in which the
work's text is written (or primarily written, if the work uses multiple
languages). This information can help potential users identify works
written in languages they know, and could also be used as a hint to
text-to-speech converters or other natural language analysis tools.</p>
<p>The value is required to be an ISO-639 two- or three-letter language
code, optionally followed by a hyphen and an ISO-3166 country code.
(For English, typical specifiers would be en-US, for US English, or
en-GB, for British English.)</p>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design systems may assume that the language is English, but should
provide the author with the opportunity to change this if it isn't.</li>
<li>Where the author has not specified any dialect, none should be
given: thus the default should be "en", not "en-US" or "en-UK".</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="headline">5.6.4. <code>&lt;headline&gt;</code></h4>
<p>The <code>&lt;headline&gt;</code> tag is optional. This is the quasi-subtitle traditionally
used in games which follow the Infocom style: for instance,</p>
<pre><code>&lt;headline&gt;An Interactive Mystery&lt;/headline&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>A suitable default value is "An Interactive Fiction".</li>
<li>This value should be cased as for <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="firstpublished">5.6.5. <code>&lt;firstpublished&gt;</code></h4>
<p>The <code>&lt;firstpublished&gt;</code> tag is optional. This is the date of first
publication: it may well not be the year in which the most recent
story file was compiled. (For example, <code>&lt;firstpublished&gt;</code> for Zork I
might be 1980, though its final compiled release was in November 1987.)</p>
<p>It is required to have either the form YYYY or YYYY-MM-DD, giving
either a year or an exact day. (YYYY-MM is illegal, and the year must
be given as four digits.)</p>
<p>Guideline:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publication implies availability to the public, whether as a free
download or for sale: availability to groups of beta testers does not
count.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="genre">5.6.6. <code>&lt;genre&gt;</code></h4>
<p>The <code>&lt;genre&gt;</code> tag is optional. This is the author's choice of description
of the genre of his work.</p>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is always going to be a highly subjective tag, and one which
no overarching consistency can reasonably be expected. The author
is encouraged (though not required) to use one (only) of the following:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="Plain"><code>    Children's Fiction, Collegiate Fiction, Comedy, Erotica, Fairy Tale,
    Fantasy, Fiction, Historical, Horror, Mystery, Non-Fiction, Other,
    Religious Fiction, Romance, Science Fiction, Surreal, Western
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>These categories are loosely based on those currently used by
bookshops, as amended by comparison with Baf's Guide.</li>
<li>"Fiction" is intended for works whose essential purpose is literary,
in a way which trumps any subject they happen to have: if Julian Barnes
writes a mystery, for instance, a bookshop will shelve it with modern
novels rather than in the detective stories section, whereas P. D.
James's Adam Dalgliesh mysteries will end up filed with detective
fiction even though she has appreciable claims to be an important
novelist.</li>
<li>"Comedy" is used rather than "humour"/"humor" to avoid the ambiguous
spelling. This genre includes parodies.</li>
<li>"Non-Fiction" would be used for a work of IF which is essentially a
presentation, perhaps in a novel interactive format, of true
information. A meticulous simulation of the Great Exhibition of 1851,
for instance, might qualify.</li>
<li>The distinction between "Surreal" and "Other" is that "Surreal" works
contain at least some semblance of narrative, whereas "Other" is
intended for works which "abuse" the format to present some entirely
different sort of game - Tetris, say, or Minesweeper.</li>
<li>A suitable default value is "Fiction", but there is no need to give
this tag at all.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="group">5.6.7. <code>&lt;group&gt;</code></h4>
<p>The <code>&lt;group&gt;</code> tag is optional. This places a given work of IF as
belonging to a given group of works.</p>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is <em>not</em> the name of a series. If the work belongs to a series
(whether numbered or not), that should be recorded in <code>&lt;series&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>&lt;group&gt;</code> for every Infocom story file is "Infocom", and similarly
for the other pre-1990 companies.</li>
<li>This tag is primarily provided so that iTunes-like browsers can
usefully subdivide collections. As such, it is likely to be edited
on many people's collections: the end user might choose to set the
<code>&lt;group&gt;</code> for a selection of files to "IF Competition 2002", or "Mystery
House Art Exhibition", etc.</li>
<li>It belongs in the <code>&lt;bibliographic&gt;</code> section partly so that the design
house can be recorded for old commercial works (see above), and partly
because the author (or design system) might as well offer at least a
suggestion. Inform 7 sets this tag to "Inform".</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="description">5.6.8. <code>&lt;description&gt;</code></h4>
<p>The <code>&lt;description&gt;</code> tag is optional, and should contain the author's
outline of the work.</p>
<p>Uniquely, this tag may contain paragraph breaks, which are written
"<code>&lt;br/&gt;</code>". No other HTML-like tags are permitted: this is plain text.
Multiple spaces, tabs, newlines, etc., are treated as single spaces
(thus typing a skipped line does not achieve a paragraph break).</p>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>The value here should be thought of as analogous to the back
cover blurb on a book, which might be read by someone picking
the book up in a casual way. Like a cover blurb, it should feel
able to "sell the product" as well as merely to itemise it.</li>
<li>Quite a good default is to use the initially-printed paragraph
of the story, then a supplementary paragraph explaining better,
or talking about the author.</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;description&gt;Sharp words between the superpowers. Tanks in
East Berlin. And now, reports the BBC, rumors of a satellite
blackout. It's enough to spoil your continental
breakfast.&lt;br/&gt;But the world will have to wait. This is the
last day of your $599 London Getaway Package, and you're
determined to soak up as much of that authentic English
ambience as you can. So you've left the tour bus behind,
ditched the camera and escaped to Hyde Park for a
contemplative stroll through the Kensington
Gardens...&lt;br/&gt;Trinity, written by Brian Moriarty and
first published by Infocom in 1986, is an intriguing fantasy
rooted both in traditional adventure games and in historical
research on the development of the atomic bomb. Dark,
literary and sophisticated, Trinity is one of the most
influential works of IF ever written.&lt;/description&gt;
</code></pre>
<h4 id="series-and-seriesnumber">5.6.9. <code>&lt;series&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;seriesnumber&gt;</code></h4>
<p>Both of these tags are optional. However, if <code>&lt;seriesnumber&gt;</code> is given,
then it is required that <code>&lt;series&gt;</code> is also given. (The reverse is not
the case: an unnumbered series is permitted.) <code>&lt;series&gt;</code> holds the
name of the series, and <code>&lt;seriesnumber&gt;</code> the position in the series,
which must be a non-negative integer. (It must <em>not</em> be text such
as "III" or "Fifth Part".)</p>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>This should be used when the game is intentionally part of a
trilogy, or other set of works intended to be played in conjunction
with each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance, the iFiction record for "Spellbreaker" might contain:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;series&gt;The Enchanter Trilogy&lt;/series&gt;
&lt;seriesnumber&gt;3&lt;/seriesnumber&gt;
</code></pre>
<h4 id="forgiveness">5.6.10. <code>&lt;forgiveness&gt;</code></h4>
<p>The <code>&lt;forgiveness&gt;</code> tag is optional. The value is information (normally
from the author) on how forgiving the story is, on the Zarfian scale.
The value is required to be one of the following, and in this casing
(i.e. initial letter the only one in upper case):</p>
<pre><code>Merciful    - cannot get stuck
Polite      - can get stuck or die, but it's immediately obvious that
            - you're stuck or dead
Tough       - can get stuck, but it's immediately obvious that you're
            about to do something irrevocable
Nasty       - can get stuck, but when you do something irrevocable,
            it's clear
Cruel       - can get stuck by doing something which isn't obviously
            irrevocable (even after the act)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="resources">5.7. Resources</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;resources&gt;</code> tag is optional. This section, if present, details
the other files (if any) which are intended to accompany the story
file, and to be available to any player. By "other" is meant files
which are not embedded in the story file. (So, for instance, pictures
in a blorbed Z-machine story file do not count as "other".)</p>
<p>It contains one or more <code>&lt;auxiliary&gt;</code> blocks. For instance:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;resources&gt;
    &lt;auxiliary&gt;
        &lt;leafname&gt;Bronze Manual.pdf&lt;/leafname&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;Manual&lt;/description&gt;
    &lt;/auxiliary&gt;
&lt;/resources&gt;
</code></pre>
<h4 id="auxiliary">5.7.1. <code>&lt;auxiliary&gt;</code></h4>
<p>This tag records the details of a single external resource. It
contains two compulsory tags:</p>
<p>The <code>&lt;leafname&gt;</code> is the filename, with any directory path removed.
By convention all resources should be filenamed with standard
file extensions, as might be used on Windows or Mac OS X. The
leafname should not include full stops (except for the extension),
slashes of either persuasion \ or /, or colons.</p>
<p>If the leafname has no extension, then it is the name of a folder.
This must contain a small web-site, with only internal links,
and whose home page is "index.html" inside the folder.</p>
<p>The <code>&lt;description&gt;</code> is a brief textual description of what the
resource is, such as might be used in a menu of downloads.</p>
<h3 id="contacts">5.8. Contacts</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;contacts&gt;</code> tag is optional.</p>
<p>If present, it can give one or both of a home page and an author's
contact email address. These should only be given where it seems
likely that they will be valid for an indefinite period of time.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;contacts&gt;
    &lt;url&gt;http://www.inform-fiction.org/&lt;/url&gt;
    &lt;authoremail&gt;graham@gnelson.demon.co.uk&lt;/authoremail&gt;
&lt;/contacts&gt;
</code></pre>
<h4 id="url">5.8.1. <code>&lt;url&gt;</code></h4>
<p>The <code>&lt;url&gt;</code> tag is optional. It must be a valid, absolute URL, and
the protocol must be "http://".</p>
<h4 id="authoremail">5.8.2. <code>&lt;authoremail&gt;</code></h4>
<p>The <code>&lt;authoremail&gt;</code> tag is optional.</p>
<p>Email addresses should be given "raw", without explanation of their
owners: so, "Graham Nelson <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#103;&#114;&#97;&#104;&#97;&#109;&#64;&#103;&#110;&#101;&#108;&#115;&#111;&#110;&#46;&#100;&#101;&#109;&#111;&#110;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#46;&#117;&#107;">&#103;&#114;&#97;&#104;&#97;&#109;&#64;&#103;&#110;&#101;&#108;&#115;&#111;&#110;&#46;&#100;&#101;&#109;&#111;&#110;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#46;&#117;&#107;</a>" is not
legal (and would cause trouble because of needing to escape the angle
brackets).</p>
<p>Multiple authors, or multiple email addresses, can be listed by
separating the entries with commas.</p>
<h3 id="cover-art">5.9. Cover art</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;cover&gt;</code> tag is optional, except that it is mandatory for an
iFiction record embedded in a story file which contains a cover
image; and the information must, of course, be correct.</p>
<p>If given, this section contains the tags below. The <code>&lt;format&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;height&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;width&gt;</code> tags are required. The <code>&lt;description&gt;</code> tag
is optional but recommended.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;cover&gt;
    &lt;format&gt;jpg&lt;/format&gt;
    &lt;height&gt;960&lt;/height&gt;
    &lt;width&gt;960&lt;/width&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;A man wearing an unusual hat.&lt;/description&gt;
&lt;/cover&gt;
</code></pre>
<h4 id="format_1">5.9.1. <code>&lt;format&gt;</code></h4>
<p>This is required to be either "jpg" or "png". No other casings,
spellings or image formats are permitted.</p>
<h4 id="height-and-width">5.9.2. <code>&lt;height&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;width&gt;</code></h4>
<p>In pixels: these are positive integers.</p>
<h4 id="description_1">5.9.3. <code>&lt;description&gt;</code></h4>
<p>This is a brief textual description of the image. An interpreter
might display this as an alternative when graphical display is not
available, or when supporting nonvisual users.
(Tag added in revision 8.)</p>
<h3 id="the-format-specific-tags">5.10. The format-specific tags</h3>
<p>An iFiction record can, optionally, have one of the following:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;zcode&gt;, &lt;glulx&gt;, &lt;tads2&gt;, &lt;tads3&gt;, &lt;hugo&gt;, &lt;alan&gt;, &lt;adrift&gt;,
&lt;level9&gt;, &lt;agt&gt;, &lt;magscrolls&gt;, &lt;advsys&gt;, &lt;html&gt;,
&lt;executable&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>It may only have the tag which matches the <code>&lt;format&gt;</code> value in the
<code>&lt;identification&gt;</code> section.</p>
<p>Each design system may specify whatever schema it likes for keys
and values in its own section. The understanding is that tools not
associated with that design system will probably not use this data.
In other words, only TADS-based utilities or interpreters are likely
ever to look at the contents of <code>&lt;tads3&gt;</code>, etc.</p>
<p>The specification for any given format can be revised without the
need to ask other parties: it "belongs" to the design system which
generate the format. (Subject to not doing anything which would
make iFiction files impracticable for others, such as including
uuencoded binary data, or violating XML rules.)</p>
<h4 id="zcode">5.10.1. <code>&lt;zcode&gt;</code></h4>
<p>This section contains only optional tags, <em>and is subject to
revision by Graham</em>.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;zcode&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;8&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;release&gt;7&lt;/release&gt;
    &lt;serial&gt;930723&lt;/serial&gt;
    &lt;checksum&gt;FF3D&lt;/checksum&gt;
    &lt;compiler&gt;Inform 7 build 3G08&lt;/compiler&gt;
    &lt;coverpicture&gt;1&lt;/coverpicture&gt;
&lt;/zcode&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The values of these tags are meaningful only when the iFiction record
is embedded with the story file, not when the iFiction record exists
externally, since they detail a specific compilation, not the project
in general. The first four should match the header entries in the story
file most recently compiled; the fifth is the most recent compiler
used. Version is the Z-machine version.</p>
<p>(Inform 7 generates <code>&lt;checksum&gt;</code> only when blorbing up an existing I6
story file in new covers. In such cases, it generates the <code>&lt;compiler&gt;</code>
by looking to see whether earlier Informs or Infocom's ZIL compiled
the story file.)</p>
<h5 id="coverpicture">5.10.1.1. <code>&lt;coverpicture&gt;</code></h5>
<p><code>&lt;coverpicture&gt;</code> is used for a Blorbed z-code story file which contains
cover art: it's the number of the picture which is used as the cover.</p>
<h4 id="tads2-and-tads3">5.10.2. <code>&lt;tads2&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;tads3&gt;</code></h4>
<p>TADS 2 and TADS 3 story files are entirely different in format, and
for purposes of the Treaty are considered independent. However,
their format-specific sections - <code>&lt;tads2&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;tads3&gt;</code> - have the
same contents.</p>
<p>This section contains only optional tags.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;tads2&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;7&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;releasedate&gt;1993-07-23&lt;/releasedate&gt;
    &lt;presentationprofile&gt;Plain Text&lt;/presentationprofile&gt;
    &lt;htmldescription&gt;This is a &lt;b&gt;terrific&lt;/b&gt; game.&lt;/htmldescription&gt;
&lt;/tads2&gt;
</code></pre>
<h5 id="presentationprofile">5.10.2.1. <code>&lt;presentationprofile&gt;</code></h5>
<p>The name of the recommended "presentation profile" for the game. This
is a hint that gives the run-time interpreter an idea of the style of
the game's user interface; interpreters can use this information to
choose the most appropriate display settings, such as fonts and
colors. Interpreters need not use this information at all; it's purely
advisory. This value can be a user-defined profile name, or one of
these pre-defined values:</p>
<p>Plain Text indicates that the game is entirely text, with no graphics
and with text formatting limited to "highlighted" text (i.e., the
traditional TADS 2 highlighting, which is usually rendered as
bold-face or equivalent). Multimedia indicates that the game makes use
of HTML text formatting effects (such as fonts, text colors, text
sizes, italics, and tables) and/or displays graphics. Default isn't a
true profile, but rather explicitly selects the default profile. Some
interpreters let the user choose a particular profile as the default,
in which case this will select that profile. Authors can, if they
wish, specify custom profile names of their own creation here, but
authors doing so are advised that (1) interpreters will not generally
be able to infer anything from profile names other than ones defined
here, and (2) other standard profile names may be added here in the
future, so custom names that authors choose could conceivably collide
with future additions.</p>
<p>The profile name isn't sensitive to case (that is, "multimedia" is
treated as equivalent to "MULTIMEDIA"). However, we recommend that if
you're using one of the pre-defined profile names listed above, you
should use the exact capitalization as shown.</p>
<p>In practical terms, the presentation profile is used by some
interpreters to select a default set of visual settings to use when
starting the game. For example, HTML TADS for Windows looks for a
"theme" that has the same name as the presentation profile, and uses
the matching theme, if any, when starting the game. An HTML TADS theme
is simply a set of font, color, and other visual settings. Other
interpreters, including all of the current text-only interpreters,
completely ignore the presentation profile setting. Authors mustn't
expect a presentation profile to select any particular color or font
scheme or to have any other specific effects, because it's up to each
interpreter to determine how to use the profile setting, if at all.</p>
<p>Note that the presentation profile does not have any effect at all on
the capabilities of the interpreter: the profile setting doesn't turn
off any features an interpreter would otherwise offer, and it doesn't
limit what kind of interpreter can be used to play the game. Selecting
the "plain text" profile, for example, does not disable graphics or
sound in an interpreter; it simply gives the interpreter guidance that
the author feels the game will look best when displayed in a style
(fonts, colors, etc.) suitable for traditional text-only games.
Similarly, selecting the "multimedia" profile doesn't prevent the game
from being played on text-only interpreters; it merely hints to
interpreters that they should use a visual style suited for a more
diverse mixture of text effects and/or graphics.</p>

Interpreters are free to disregard this entirely. It is suggested that
interpreters constrain their display size to reflect the aspect ratio
indicated by these values -- though they should not force the user to use
these exact dimensions. These exact values may be used to set the initial
size of the display if possible (though they should be scaled to not exceed
the size of the user's screen).</p>

<h3 id="releases">5.11. Releases</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;releases&gt;</code> section is optional. It is important to stress that the
bulk of an iFiction record - and in particular its <code>&lt;identification&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;bibliographic&gt;</code> sections - document a work of IF throughout all the
editions it has, not any individual release of that work.</p>
<p>Information about specific releases may be placed in this section:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;releases&gt;
    &lt;attached&gt;
        &lt;release&gt;
        ...
        &lt;/release&gt;
    &lt;/attached&gt;
    &lt;history&gt;
        &lt;release&gt;
        ...
        &lt;/release&gt;
        &lt;release&gt;
        ...
        &lt;/release&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/history&gt;
&lt;/releases&gt;
</code></pre>
<h4 id="attached-and-history">5.11.1. <code>&lt;attached&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;history&gt;</code></h4>
<p>The <code>&lt;attached&gt;</code> tag is optional. It may only exist in an iFiction record
attached to a specific story file. So, for instance, a compiler of a
story file is entitled to write about the <code>&lt;attached&gt;</code> release: but the
IF-archive, when serving an iFiction record to the public based on an
IFID alone, must not serve <code>&lt;attached&gt;</code> - it contains data which is not
determined by the IFID.</p>
<p><code>&lt;history&gt;</code> is optional, and can legally be served by the IF-archive.
It consists of a release history for the work, and contains one or more
<code>&lt;release&gt;</code> blocks, which must be all distinct from each other (i.e., no
two <code>&lt;release&gt;</code> blocks in the <code>&lt;history&gt;</code> can contain identical data).
<code>&lt;release&gt;</code> blocks may be placed in any order.</p>
<p>It is not required that the release in the <code>&lt;attached&gt;</code> tag, if there is
one, be included in the <code>&lt;history&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>It is not required that any release in the <code>&lt;history&gt;</code> list should have
the same date as the one given in <code>&lt;firstpublished&gt;</code>. In general, a
<code>&lt;history&gt;</code> list is not obliged to be complete.</p>
<h4 id="release">5.11.2. <code>&lt;release&gt;</code></h4>
<p>A <code>&lt;release&gt;</code> should have the form:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;release&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;3&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;releasedate&gt;2005-11-30&lt;/releasedate&gt;
    &lt;compiler&gt;Inform 7&lt;/compiler&gt;
    &lt;compilerversion&gt;3D26&lt;/compilerversion&gt;
&lt;/release&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>&lt;releasedate&gt;</code> is compulsory but the other two tags are optional.</p>
<p><code>&lt;releasedate&gt;</code> has the same format as <code>&lt;firstpublished&gt;</code>: YYYY or
YYYY-MM-DD.</p>
<p><code>&lt;version&gt;</code> must be a non-negative integer.</p>
<p><code>&lt;compiler&gt;</code> is the design system used to compile the story file. Only
very major version numbers should be present, if at all (e.g. "TADS 3"
or "Inform 6" but not "Inform 6.12").</p>
<p><code>&lt;compilerversion&gt;</code> may only be present if <code>&lt;compiler&gt;</code> is present.
Different compilers will have different notations for their versions.</p>
<p>The release date can be the date of compilation of the released story
file, if known, rather than the day on which commercial distribution
began.</p>
<h3 id="colophon">5.12. Colophon</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;colophon&gt;</code> tag is optional. It identifies the tool which wrote the
.iFiction record, and also the date at which the data originates.
Presented with multiple .iFiction records for the same story, a utility
should use the colophon to determine which is the most recent.</p>
<p>The colophon may be updated whenever a program or editor makes
substantive changes to the .iFiction record. Operations which do not
change the content of the .iFiction record (such as extraction from, or
aggregation to, a multi-record file, or encapsulation within a wrapper
or story file) should not change the colophon.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;colophon&gt;
  &lt;generator&gt;Inform 7&lt;/generator&gt;
  &lt;generatorversion&gt;3F47&lt;/generatorversion&gt;
  &lt;originated&gt;2006-04-12&lt;/originated&gt;
&lt;/colophon&gt;
</code></pre>
<h4 id="generator">5.12.1. <code>&lt;generator&gt;</code></h4>
<p><code>&lt;generator&gt;</code> is mandatory within <code>&lt;colophon&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>This is the name of the system which created this iFiction record. For
iFiction files generated by hand, this should be the name of the person
or organization responsible for generating the iFiction file.</p>
<p>At this time, likely values for <code>&lt;generator&gt;</code> include:</p>
<pre><code>Inform 7        - for metadata generated by the inform compiler
Zoom            - for metadata generated by the Zoom interpreter
Babel           - for metadata generated by babel*
ifarchive.org   - for metadata compiled by the maintainers of the if-archive
</code></pre>
<p>* Though babel extracts iFiction files from various sources, it only
generates a colophon when it is creating or modifying metadata, as in
the case where it is synthesizing metadata from a story file which does
not contain an iFiction record as such (e.g., when synthesising an
iFiction record from the GameInfo structure inside a TADS story file).</p>
<h4 id="generatorversion">5.12.2. <code>&lt;generatorversion&gt;</code></h4>
<p><code>&lt;generatorversion&gt;</code> is optional within <code>&lt;colophon&gt;</code>.</p>
<p><code>&lt;version&gt;</code> refers to the version of the generator used to produce the file.
This can be used to isolate cases where an obsolete tool has been used to
produce metadata. Story file compilers should follow the same conventions
here as for <code>&lt;compiler&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;compilerversion&gt;</code> in a <code>&lt;release&gt;</code> tag (see
above).</p>
<p>Babel uses the revision of this treaty which it supports. Hand-written
.iFiction files should not use <code>&lt;generatorversion&gt;</code>.</p>
<h4 id="originated">5.12.3. <code>&lt;originated&gt;</code></h4>
<p><code>&lt;originated&gt;</code> is mandatory within <code>&lt;colophon&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>This is the best estimate of the date at which the bibliographic data
in the iFiction record was last approved by the author of the work
being described. This should be the date most useful in determining the
freshness of the .iFiction data.</p>
<p>If a design system is compiling a story file and including an iFiction
record with it, then <code>&lt;originated&gt;</code> will normally be the compilation date.</p>
<p>However, a third-party tool which synthesizes metadata from a story file
should use either the compilation date (if it can be determined) of the
story file, or else the compilation date of the tool itself. It should
<em>not</em> use the date on which synthesis occurred, as this would result
in obsolete metadata receiving current dates.</p>
<p>Abstractly, the <code>&lt;originated&gt;</code> tag should contain the earliest date on
which this metadata could have been created, not necessarily the date
on which it actually was created.</p>
<h3 id="annotation">5.13. Annotation</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;annotation&gt;</code> tag is optional. For an iFiction record embedded in
a story file or otherwise produced by a design system, it is forbidden.
It will not normally be present in any iFiction record served by
the IF-archive.</p>
<p>The purpose of the <code>&lt;annotation&gt;</code> section is to allow tools such as
iTunes-like browsers to store user-specified or other convenient
information, without violating the iFiction schema.</p>
<p>Any such tool should use a subsection under its own name.</p>
<h4 id="zoom">5.13.1. <code>&lt;zoom&gt;</code></h4>
<p>Reserved for the use of Andrew Hunter's interpreter "Zoom". Its
tags include:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;comment&gt;
    Any user comments on the story
&lt;rating&gt;
    The user rating, a value between 0 and 10 where 0=worst and
    10=best.
&lt;story&gt;
    The URL of the story file
&lt;graphics&gt;
    The URL of a file containing graphics for the story
&lt;sounds&gt;
    The URL of a file containing sounds for the story
    (note that these are likely to be local file URLs, and may change
    as Zoom reorganises its collection; any two or all three may
    coincide, if a blorb is used)
&lt;savegame tag="Description" date="savedate"&gt;
    The URL of a saved game for the story. (There can be several
    such tags.) The description text is shown to the player as one
    of the restore options, and Zoom creates this by summarising the
    status bar contents when the game is saved. The date specifies
    when the game was saved.

            It's the last day of your $599 London vacation. Unfortunately,
            it's also the first day of World War III. Only seconds remain
            before an H-bomb vaporizes the city... and you with it.

            Unless you escape to another time, another dimension.

            For every atomic explosion unlocks the door to a secret
            universe; a plane between fantasy and reality, filled with
            curious artifacts and governed by its own mischievous logic.
            You'll crisscross time and space as you explore this
            fascinating universe, learning to control its inexorable power.
            &lt;br/&gt;
            Trinity leads you on a journey back to the dawn of the atomic

<h4 id="dungeon-adventure">5.14.4. "Dungeon Adventure"</h4>
<p>Level 9 games are an interesting test case, since although Level 9 did
have a reasonably well-defined virtual machine, its story files were
only ever circulated embedded in interpreters: a tool by Paul David
Doherty cuts out the story file, but does fairly horrible things to
achieve this. There is no good identification procedure to tell whether
an arbitrary file is a Level 9 story file: and the IFID below is another
case where we have to resort to an MD5 checksum.</p>

<h3 id="the-sparse-ifiction-format">5.15. The sparse iFiction format</h3>
<p>For legacy story files and for story files generated by a system which
does not provide iFiction support, it may be necessary to write
.iFiction data by hand. It would be tedious and error-prone to insert
IFIDs by hand, but the Babel software is able to fill in missing
IFIDs. An iFiction record which is missing its identification is
called "sparse".</p>
<p>Formally, a "sparse" .iFiction record conforms to the same
specification as a normal .iFiction file, except that the
<code>&lt;identification&gt;</code> section is optional.</p>
<p>Babel provides a facility to "complete" a sparse .iFiction file,
turning it into a complete .iFiction file by analyzing a story file.</p>
<p>This process has the following caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>If no <code>&lt;identification&gt;</code> section is found in the sparse .iFiction, a
  new one will be added</li>
<li>If an <code>&lt;identification&gt;</code> section is found, the <code>&lt;format&gt;</code> tag must match
  the format of the provided story file</li>
<li>If the <code>&lt;ifid&gt;</code> of the provided story file is not found, it will be
  added.</li>
</ul>
<p>(An <code>&lt;identification&gt;</code> section is allowed in sparse .iFiction to deal with
legacy projects which have more than one IFID.)</p>
<h2 data-tocname="A" id="appendix-babel-a-users-guide">A. Appendix: Babel: a user's guide</h2>
<p>The specification below is <em>not</em> formally part of the treaty, and exact
syntaxes may change, but it seems worth documenting the tool here,
particularly since it will likely be used by all of the parties to the
treaty.</p>
<h3 id="using-babel-on-the-command-line">A.1. Using babel on the command line</h3>
<p>In the specification below, <code>&lt;storyfilename&gt;</code> must not be a zip
archive (i.e. end in ".zip" with some casing), or a .iFiction file:
babel should halt with an error if so.</p>
<p>Conversely, <code>&lt;ifictionfilename&gt;</code> must be a ".iFiction" file.</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>babel -ifid &lt;storyfilename&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Examines the named story file and prints output as follows:</p>
<pre><code>IFID: 1974A053-7DB0-4103-93A1-767C1382C0B7
</code></pre>
<p>Note that babel must determine the IFID using the algorithm in 2.2
above - in particular, falling back on MD5 if all else fails. It is
therefore not possible for this usage to fail to print a IFID (so
long as the file is not a zip archive, no file-system accidents
occur, etc.). If more than one IFID is recorded, because the story
file contains metadata which lists more than one IFID, a list is
printed:</p>
<pre><code>IFID: 731F0480-5CB5-4340-B65B-384FC6B1F5B4
IFID: ZCODE-8-040205-6630
</code></pre>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>babel -identify &lt;storyfilename&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Prints out a brief summary of the story file, in the following form:</p>
<pre><code>"When in Rome", by Emily Short
IFID: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
blorbed zcode, 517K, cover 960x960 jpeg

No bibliographic data
IFID: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
zcode, 180K, no cover
</code></pre>
<p>Printing is done in a Terminal-safe way: the text of the title and
author's name might be any Unicode characters, but all characters
outside the Unicode range 0x20 to 0x7E will be flattened to underscores.</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>babel -ifid &lt;ifictionfilename&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Similar, but outputs the IFIDs recorded in <code>&lt;ifid&gt;</code> tags in the iFiction
file supplied: there must be at least one in each of the <code>&lt;story&gt;</code>
sections in that file. (It is legal for an iFiction file which is
separate from a story file to record data on more than one story:
this usage of babel should list every IFID from every story.)</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>babel -format &lt;storyfilename&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Examines the named story file and prints output as in the following
examples:</p>
<pre><code>Format: zcode
Format: blorbed glulx
Format: tads3
Format: unknown
</code></pre>
<p>This should be determined using the recognition algorithm determined
below. The format name will be one of those used in the iFiction
<code>&lt;format&gt;</code> tag, or "unknown" if there is no indication what it is.
The prefix "blorbed" indicates that the story file is embedded in a
blorb archive. (The combination "blorbed unknown" is impossible, since
the blorb format explicitly requires a statement of the story file's
format.)</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>babel -ifiction &lt;storyfilename&gt; [-to &lt;directory&gt;]
</code></pre>

<p>Extracts a .iFiction file to a file named XXXXX.iFiction, where XXXXX
is the primary (first-listed) IFID; to the current working directory
by default, and otherwise to the given "-to" directory.</p>
<p>If successful, babel prints:</p>
<pre><code>Extracted XXXXX.iFiction
</code></pre>
<p>(or whatever leafname it has). If there is no iFiction record, babel
prints</p>
<pre><code>No iFiction record for XXXXX
</code></pre>
<p>This is printed to stdout, not stderr: it isn't an error.</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>babel -cover &lt;storyfilename&gt; [-to &lt;directory&gt;]
</code></pre>

<p>Identical to babel -ifiction, but for the cover art, which should have
the filename XXXXX.jpg or XXXXX.png. On success, prints</p>
<pre><code>Extracted XXXXX.jpg (960x960)
</code></pre>
<p>(or .png, as appropriate); the dimensions given are width x height. On
failure,</p>
<pre><code>No cover art for XXXXX
</code></pre>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>babel -verify &lt;ifictionfilename&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Verifies the .iFiction file for adherence to this standard, to the best
of babel's abilities. If the file is apparently correct, prints</p>
<pre><code>Verified &lt;first-IFID-in-file&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If not, prints suitable errors to stderr.</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>babel -fish &lt;storyfilename&gt; [-to &lt;directory&gt;]
</code></pre>

<p>A sort of super-extractor, this fishes out both the cover art and the
iFiction record - where present - printing output as in -ifiction and
-cover above. <em>However</em>, in the event that the story file records
multiple IFIDs, copies are created for each IFID present, not simply
for the first. Thus, for instance:</p>
<pre><code>$ babel -fish Savoir.zblorb
Extracted 731F0480-5CB5-4340-B65B-384FC6B1F5B4.iFiction
Extracted ZCODE-8-040205-6630.iFiction
Extracted 731F0480-5CB5-4340-B65B-384FC6B1F5B4.jpg (960x960)
Extracted ZCODE-8-040205-6630.jpg (960x960)
$
</code></pre>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>babel -fish &lt;ifictionfilename&gt; [-to &lt;directory&gt;]
</code></pre>

<p>Each individual <code>&lt;story&gt;</code> record in the iFiction file is written out,
as an iFiction file in its own right, and named in the usual
XXXXX.iFiction way. Moreover, if a <code>&lt;story&gt;</code> records more than one
IFID, a copy is made for each of these IFIDs.</p>
<p>(Thus, for instance, a single iFiction file containing data on all
of the Level 9 games could be expanded into individual records
suitable for use by the IF-archive.)</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>babel -lint &lt;ifictionfile&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As "-verify", but also checks for compliance with the stylistic
guidelines of this document.</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>babel -complete &lt;storyfile&gt; &lt;ifictionfile&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Completes the sparse ifictionfile using information from storyfile.
Writes the output to XXXX.iFiction, where XXXX is the ifid of the story.</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>babel -story &lt;storyfile&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If the story file is inside a container format, extracts just the
story file. If not, copies the input file.  In either case, it creates
XXXX.EXT, where XXXX is the ifid of the file, and ext is the
recommended extension for the story file.</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>babel -unblorb &lt;storyfile&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As "-fish", but also extracts the story file.</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>babel -blorb &lt;storyfile&gt; &lt;ifictionfile&gt; [&lt;cover art&gt;]
</code></pre>

<p>Creates a blorb container consisting of the story file, ifiction file
and, optionally, the cover art.  The resulting file is named XXXX.blorb
where XXX is the ifid of the story file.  If the ifiction file is
sparse, it will be completed first.</p>
<h4 id="using-babel-in-a-pipe">A.1.1. Using babel in a pipe</h4>
<p>As one of the intended uses of babel is as a back-end to other
applications, it may be desirable to invoke the program as part of a
pipeline.  The following features are available to facilitate this,
though the exact syntax of their use may vary according to the
conventions of the host platform.</p>
<h5 id="piping-data-into-babel">A.1.1.1. Piping data into babel</h5>
<p>With the exception of -blorb, any of the operations listed above as
taking <code>&lt;ifictionfile&gt;</code> as input can use the filename "<code>-</code>" to read from
standard input instead.  In UNIX-like syntax, the following two
commands are equivalent:</p>
<pre><code>babel -verify - &lt; ZCODE-67-000000.iFiction
babel -verify ZCODE-67-000000.iFiction
</code></pre>
<p>This can be useful when coupled with a tool such as babel-get. For
instance,</p>
<pre><code>babel-get -ifiction ZCODE-67-000000 -url http://babel.ifarchive.org
    | babel -verify -
</code></pre>
<p>will download and verify the .iFiction record for Sorcerer.</p>
<h5 id="piping-data-out-of-babel">A.1.1.2. Piping data out of babel</h5>
<pre><code>babel -meta &lt;storyfile&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Extracts the iFiction record from the specified story file and prints it to
standard output, so that it can be piped into a program which reads
.iFiction. For example: </p>
<pre><code>babel -meta lakeside.zblorb | babel -verify -
</code></pre>
<p>will verify the .iFiction data contained within lakeside.zblorb.</p>
<h3 id="the-babel-handler-api">A.2. The Babel handler API</h3>
<p>As a command-line utility, the babel tool performs basic analysis on
both story files and iFiction records. The latter task is no more
than routine XML parsing, but babel's functions to handle story files
may be very helpful to tools such as interpreters and browsers, and
it makes these functions available as the "babel handler", contained
in the file babel_handler.c.</p>
<p>The babel handler performs the following tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>loads a story file from disk;</li>
<li>determines the format of the story file and selects the correct treaty
   functions for dealing with it;</li>
<li>seamlessly handles integration of container formats.</li>
</ol>
<p>That is, once the babel handler has been initialized with a story file,
it will forward treaty requests to the proper handler or to the container
format's handler.</p>
<p>This is the babel_handler API:</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>void *get_babel_ctx(void);
void release_babel_ctx(void *);
</code></pre>

<p>These functions create and destroy an opaque context object used by
the babel handler. Each context object describes one currently loaded
file. If you wish to process files in parallel (as a multithreaded
application might), you should use a separate context object for each
file (that is, each thread. On the other hand, if you want to have
separate threads handle, say, the cover art and metadata on the <em>same</em>
file, they should use the same context object).</p>
<p>The object returned by <code>get_babel_ctx</code> is passed as the last parameter to
each of the remaining functions:</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>char *babel_init_ctx(char *filename, void *);
</code></pre>

<p>Initializes the babel handler with the given file.  This function must
be called successfully before any other babel handler function can be
called.  On a successful load, this returns the name of the format.
If this fails, it will return NULL.  If it returns NULL, you must not
use any of the other functions, except <code>babel_release_ctx</code>,
<code>babel_md5_ifid_ctx</code> and <code>babel_get_length_ctx</code>.</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>char *babel_init_raw_ctx(void *story_file, int32 extent, void *)
</code></pre>

<p>Does the same thing, but uses a story file which has already been loaded
into memory. (Note that this will preclude the babel_handler's usual
file extension checking.)</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>int32 babel_treaty_ctx(int32 selector, void *output,
                       int32 output_extent, void *);
</code></pre>

<p>Calls the proper treaty module for the given selector (the story file and
story file extent are ommitted, as these are inferred from the babel handler
context).  This function will correctly and invisibly handle container
formats.</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>void babel_release_ctx(void *);
</code></pre>

<p>This releases the resources held by the given babel handler context.  You
must call this when you are done with the file loaded by <code>babel_init_ctx</code>, even
if <code>babel_init_ctx</code> returned NULL.  Once this is called, the babel handler
context must not be used until it is re-initialized.</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>char *babel_get_format_ctx(void *);
</code></pre>

<p>This returns the format of the loaded file.  For story files not
inside a container, this is identical to the value returned by the
<code>GET_FORMAT_NAME_SEL</code> treaty selector.  For story files contained within
a container format, the returned name is a composite, such as "blorbed zcode".</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>int32 babel_md5_ifid_ctx(char *buffer, int extent, void *);
</code></pre>

<p>This generates an IFID for the loaded story file using the last-resort method
of using an MD5 hash.  Note that if <code>GET_STORY_FILE_IFID_SEL</code> returns a positive
number, this is not the actual IFID.  This function can be used even if
<code>babel_init_ctx</code> returned NULL.  Returns nonzero so long as an MD5 can be
generated (It will fail only if the file does not exist at all or
the provided output buffer is less than 33 bytes long)</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>int32 babel_get_length_ctx(void *);
</code></pre>

<p>This function returns the length of the loaded story file in bytes.</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>int32 babel_get_story_length_ctx(void *);
</code></pre>

<p>As <code>babel_get_length_ctx</code>, but if the story file is in a container,
returns just the length of the story itself.</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>int32 babel_get_authoritative_ctx(void *)
</code></pre>

<p>Returns true if the loaded story file's format has been positively
identified.</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>void *babel_get_file_ctx(void *);
</code></pre>

<p>Returns a pointer to the actual loaded story file.</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>void *babel_get_story_file_ctx(void *);
</code></pre>

<p>As <code>babel_get_file_ctx</code>, but, if the story file is inside a container,
return just the story file, not the container.</p>
<p>Applications which only need to deal with one story file at a time can use
the non-parallelizable form of these functions:</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>char *babel_init(char *filename);
char *babel_init_raw(void *story_file, int32 extent);
int32 babel_treaty(int32 selector, void *output, int32 output_extent);
void babel_release(void);
char *babel_get_format(void);
int32 babel_md5_ifid(char *buffer, int32 extent);
int32 babel_get_length(void);
int32 babel_get_file(void);
int32 babel_get_authoritative(void);
</code></pre>

<p>These do not take a context object, instead using a "default" context.</p>
<p>babel_handler.c relies on the module registry, contained in register.c and
modules.h.  modules.h contains macros which announce the known story and
container formats.</p>
<p>It also relies on misc.c for the <code>my_malloc</code> function.  You may provide your
own replacement for <code>my_malloc</code> if you use some other allocator.</p>
<h3 id="support-for-general-containers">A.3. Support for general containers</h3>
<p>For the purposes of babel, a container format is treated similarly to a
story file format.</p>
<p>When contributing a new container format to babel, a container format
should define the following function:</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>int32 CONTAINER_treaty(void *container_file, int32 container_extent,
                       void *output, int32 output_extent)
</code></pre>

<p>(<code>CONTAINER</code> should be replaced by the common name of the container format.)
This function should perform the same functions as a <code>SYSTEM_treaty</code>
function, except that it should accept three additional selectors:</p>
<pre><code>                                    container_file  output
CONTAINER_GET_STORY_FORMAT_SEL      not null        not null
CONTAINER_GET_STORY_EXTENT_SEL      not null        null
CONTAINER_GET_STORY_SEL             not null        not null
</code></pre>
<p><code>CONTAINER_GET_STORY_FORMAT_SEL</code> copies the treaty name of the format
of the contained story file into the output buffer, returning &gt;0 if
all went well. The value output by this selector should be the same
as would be output by calling <code>GET_FORMAT_NAME_SEL</code> on the corresponding
treaty module. (Though this is no guarantee that <code>CLAIM_STORY_FILE_SEL</code>
will accept the story file: <code>CONTAINER_GET_STORY_FORMAT_SEL</code> is not
expected to do any more than consult the container's formatting data.
For example, an erroneous blorb file may claim to contain a zcode
story file when it actually contains a glulx.)</p>
<p><code>CONTAINER_GET_STORY_EXTENT_SEL</code> returns the size, in bytes, of the
story file contained in the container.</p>
<p><code>CONTAINER_GET_STORY_SEL</code> copies the story file from the container into
the output buffer, returning the number of bytes copied if all went well.</p>
<p>Because a container module is compatible with a story file treaty
module, a simple tool may not need to distinguish between the two.
However, any tool which needs to do sophisticated analysis should
consult the <code>CONTAINER_treaty</code> function, then the <code>SYSTEM_treaty</code>
function for the story file contained therein should the container
not be able to ascertain the necesary information (especially for
<code>GET_STORY_FILE_IFID_SEL</code>).</p>
<p>(Note: <code>GET_FORMAT_NAME_SEL</code> on a container format should return the
name of the container format. Depending on your desired usage, you may
want to check one, the other, or both. For instance, the babel tool
composes both in the form "CONTAINERed SYSTEM": e.g., "blorbed zcode".)</p>
<h3 id="definitions-made-in-treatyh">A.4. Definitions made in treaty.h</h3>
<p>treaty.h is a portable C header file which defines the various symbolic
constants which should be used in treaty modules.</p>
<p>Not everything in treaty.h is required by the Treaty of Babel; it also
includes several definitions to simplify the lives of programmers.</p>
<p>It defines these values:</p>
<p>Return values for the <code>SYSTEM_treaty</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>NO_REPLY_RV
INVALID_STORY_FILE_RV
UNAVAILABLE_RV
INVALID_USAGE_RV
VALID_STORY_FILE_RV
INCOMPLETE_REPLY_RV
</code></pre>
<p>Cover art types:</p>
<pre><code>PNG_COVER_FORMAT
JPEG_COVER_FORMAT
</code></pre>
<p>SYSTEM_treaty selectors:</p>
<pre><code>GET_HOME_PAGE_SEL
GET_FORMAT_NAME_SEL
GET_FILE_EXTENSIONS_SEL
CLAIM_STORY_FILE_SEL
GET_STORY_FILE_METADATA_EXTENT_SEL
GET_STORY_FILE_COVER_EXTENT_SEL
GET_STORY_FILE_COVER_FORMAT_SEL
GET_STORY_FILE_IFID_SEL
GET_STORY_FILE_METADATA_SEL
GET_STORY_FILE_COVER_SEL
</code></pre>
<p>These bitmasks are provided to help group selectors by their requirements:</p>
<pre><code>TREATY_SELECTOR_INPUT           if the selector requires a story file
TREATY_SELECTOR_OUTPUT          if the selector requires an output buffer
TREATY_SELECTOR_NUMBER          removes these flags from the selector
</code></pre>
<p>The treaty insists that programs supply output buffers at least this big:</p>
<pre><code>TREATY_MINIMUM_EXTENT           currently 512 bytes
</code></pre>
<p>treaty.h also reserves three selectors for container formats:</p>
<pre><code>CONTAINER_GET_STORY_FORMAT_SEL
CONTAINER_GET_STORY_EXTENT_SEL
CONTAINER_GET_STORY_FILE_SEL
</code></pre>
<p>and <code>TREATY_CONTAINER_SELECTOR</code>, which is a bitmask to detect these three
selectors.</p>
<p>treaty.h also declares two types:</p>
<pre><code>TREATY          a pointer to a SYSTEM_treaty function
int32           a 32-bit signed integer
</code></pre>
<h3 id="the-babel-ifiction-api">A.5. The Babel iFiction API</h3>
<p>The Babel iFiction API is a simple XML parser geared toward the
metadata format used by this treaty. It is no substitute for a proper
XML parser, but will suffice for simple programs which don't wish to
be encumbered by a heavy-weight XML library.</p>
<p>The Babel iFiction API is made up from the files ifiction.c, and
register_ifiction.c. It also uses the <code>my_malloc</code> function found in
misc.c.</p>
<p>The iFiction API consists of these methods:</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>int32 ifiction_get_IFID(char *metadata, char *output, int32 output_extent);
</code></pre>

<p>Copies a comma separated list of the IFIDs found in the metadata into output.
Returns the number of IFIDs found. Note that this may be 0 if the metadata
is a sparse iFiction record: if the record is known not to be sparse, a
return value of 0 indicates there is something wrong with the metadata.</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>char *ifiction_get_tag(char *md, char *p, char *t, char *from);
</code></pre>

<p>Returns the content of tag t within container tag p
(so ifiction_get_tag(md, "bibliographic", "title") would return the title of
a work), or NULL if it is not found.
This function returns newly allocated heap memory, which must be freed
by the calling context.
To find the first matching tag in the file, pass the value NULL as the
final parameter.  To find subsequent occurences, pass the value returned by
the previous call.</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>void ifiction_parse(char *md, IFCloseTag close_tag, void *close_ctx,
                    IFErrorHandler error_handler, void *error_ctx);
</code></pre>

<p>Processes md.  <code>close_tag(tag,close_ctx)</code> is called as each tag is closed.
<code>error_handler(char *, error_ctx)</code> is passed a string for any error encountered.
You may print errors or ignore them, depending on your needs; processing will
continue unless an error is very serious. (Note in particular that reading
the "identification" section in a sparse iFiction record, which lacks such
a section, will generate errors.)</p>
<p>The error_handler argument to ifiction_parse has the following signature:</p>
<pre><code>void (*IFErrorHandler)(char *error_text, void *error_context);
</code></pre>
<p>The close_tag argument has this syntax:</p>
<pre><code>void (*IFCloseTag)(struct XMLTag *tag, void *context);
</code></pre>
<p>Where struct XMLTag is defined as:</p>
<pre><code>struct XMLTag
{
 int32 beginl;                  /* Beginning line number */
 char tag[256];                 /* name of the tag */
 char fulltag[256];             /* Full text of the opening tag */
 char *begin;                   /* Points to the beginning of the tag's content */
 char *end;                     /* Points to the end of the tag's content.
                                   setting *end=0 will turn begin into a string
                                   containing the tag's content (But if you do this, you
                                   should restore the original value of *end before
                                   allowing control to return to the ifiction parser) */
 char occurences[256];          /* reserved for internal use */
 char rocurrences[256];
 struct XMLTag *next;           /* The tag's parent */

<h3 id="the-babel-get-program">A.6. The babel-get program</h3>
<p>babel-get is a utility to retrieve metadata for a story. It requires
that "curl" (<a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">http://curl.haxx.se/</a>) be installed.</p>
<p>Usage:</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>babel-get -ifiction [&lt;IFID&gt;] -story &lt;storyfile&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Prints the metadata for the given story.  No output if metadata is not found
or if an IFID which does not match the story file is given.</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>babel-get -ifiction [&lt;IFID&gt;] -ifiction &lt;ifictionfile&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If an IFID is given, finds the corresponding ifiction record from the given
file. If not, prints the first ifiction record in the given file.</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>babel-get -ifiction &lt;IFID&gt; -dir &lt;ifiction directory&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Scans all ifiction files in the given directory for the ifiction
record of the corresponding IFID and prints it.</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>babel-get -ifiction &lt;IFID&gt; -url &lt;url&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Retrieves the ifiction record for the given IFID from the given server
and prints it.</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>babel-get -cover [&lt;IFID&gt;] -story &lt;storyfile&gt; [-to &lt;directory&gt;]
</code></pre>

<p>Creates <IFID>.jpg or <IFID>.png, containing the cover art for
the specified file.</p>
<pre class="DefFun"><code>babel-get -cover &lt;IFID&gt; -url &lt;url&gt; [-to &lt;directory&gt;]
</code></pre>

<p>Downloads <IFID>.jpg from the given server.</p>
<p><code>&lt;url&gt;</code> should be an http://, ftp:// or file:// style URL.</p>
</body>
